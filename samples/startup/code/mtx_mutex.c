/* Sketch of semaphore implementation using decorated CAST operation. The problem arises
   from the fact that the success of the swap operation is not reported. We need to read
   back to see. To distinguish our store from those with same value by another core we need
   to limit the value range and to spend the other bits for ownership of a value:
     In the sketch the semaphore value range is 5 Bit, 0..31. Mask is 0x1f.
     Bit 7, 0x80 means value is owned by core 0.
     Bit 6, 0x40 means value is owned by core 1.
     Bit 5, 0x20 means value is owned by core 2.
     The new value is written together with an ownership bit. This can be done at once in
   an atomic fashion. A core will not change a value explicitly owned by another core and
   this makes it possible to do the read-back and further manipulations without the
   atomicity, i.e. harmful interference of another core. In order to not block the entire
   process, the last step - when all decisions are taken - is to deletion of the ownership
   bit.
     @remark Since this is a busy-wait non-atomic implementation (i.e. busy wait for access
   to the semaphore not fore the availability of the protected resources) it must not be
   used without another core-local critical section, e.g. suspend all interrupts. Otherwise
   either an other core needs to await the completion of unrelated local scheduling
   activities or we can run destroy the counter value because of competing accesses to the
   semaphore from eachother preempting contexts on the local core.
     @remark Effectively the proposed implementation is a combination of a core-selective
   mutex and a counter. Using the normal mutex and a normal shared-memory variable for
   counting would be just the same. No need to implement this sketch. */
