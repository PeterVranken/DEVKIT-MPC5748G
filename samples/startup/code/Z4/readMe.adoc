This folder contains those source files, which implement code that is
going to run solely on the Z4 cores. The makefile recognizes the syllable
"Z4" in the file path and will select the e200z4 target settings.

The most relevant difference between the two cores Z2 and Z4 is
availability of the floating point instructions for Z4. A source file,
which uses floating point instructions is a likely candidate for a Z4
compilation. If compiled for Z2 it can still be run on the Z4 cores but
the performance is strongly degraded due to the use of floating point
emulation code.
