= Basic Test of safe-RTOS

This folder contains a test sequence of the RTOS's protection mechanisms.
Three processes are configured.

The process with lowest privileges is used to report the status through
the serial interface. It is normally programmed, so we expect it to make
no errors and nor must its operability be harmed by the second process.

The second process with medium privileges is programmed to produce a long
list of imaginable failures. It is a kind of state machine and selects
another failure to produce in every new run. Occasionally it'll try doing
operations without a failure to see that it is then normally running.

The second process has two more tasks besides the failure injecting task
-- one of higher, one of lower priority. We check if these two mostly
continue running despite of the failing task. Note, the RTOS cannot in
general guarantee that a process's task A is not harmed by its other
failing task B; B could of course destroy essential data from A, among more
the shared stack. This depends on the kind of injected error.

The third process has highest privileges. It controls and supervises the
second process. It selects the failure or successful operation to execute
and looks after the (failing) task execution in process 2 if the
diagnostic APIs report the expected caught error or if the operation
succeeded as expected.

Process 3 has two tasks, which are associated with the same event as the
failure producing task of process 2. This guarantees race condition free
execution of the three task functions, which is a prerequisite for the
otherwise impossible sharp evaluation of the diagnosed errors - normally
an error in another process will be asynchronous and not be strictly
relatable to a specific operation of the other process.

Status of the test is printed to the serial port of the evaluation board.
Open a terminal on the host machine to read the output: 115200 Bd, 8 Bit,
1 Stop bit, no parity. Additionally, the successfully running test enables
a blinking LED on the board. It would stop blinking in case of a
recognized problem (or even a crashing system).
