/**
 * @file nwl_ioSysNewLib.c
 * Low level I/O bindings for the C library, implementation newlib. If the code is linked
 * against this library without the linker command line switch -specs=nosys.specs the
 * function from stdio (gets, puts, printf, etc.) refer to unresolved symbols. These are
 * the low level I/O functions, which bind the generic implementation of the C lib
 * functions to concrete, platform dependent I/O channels.\n
 *   This module offers a set of I/O functions, which suffice to make the character output
 * functions puts, printf, etc. work well through the serial interface of the
 * DEVKIT-MPC5748G, but which do not support streamed character input (gets) and likely
 * some more not yet identified C lib functions.\n
 *   One of the basic functions, implemented here is sbrk(), the lowest layer of the memory
 * management of the C lib. Therefore, malloc etc. are expected to work, too. This has
 * however not been tested yet.
 *   @remark
 * The connection of the serial input interface to the C library was not possible. The
 * way, how the C library functions request more chunks of data from the stream does not fit
 * to the character of a serial input, which can be temporarily exhausted but which will
 * have new data some time later. We couldn't find a way to satisfy the interface of the C
 * library (mainly through function read()) without unacceptable blocking states. As far as
 * input is concerned, you will have to build your application directly on the API of
 * module sio_serialIO.c.
 *   @remark
 * The operation of the functions offered here strongly depend on the availability of memory
 * space. The total memory space available to the function is defined in the linker file.
 * As a matter of experience, the printf function family requires about 6 kByte of RAM. If
 * the client code make use of malloc then an according additional amount of memory should
 * be reserved for the C lib. See comments here in the implementation and in the linker
 * file for more details.
