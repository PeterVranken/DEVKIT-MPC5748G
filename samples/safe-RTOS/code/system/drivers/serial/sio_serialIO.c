/**
 * @file sio_serialIO.c
 * Support of the LINFlex 2 device of the MPC5748G for serial text I/O. The device is
 * configured as UART and fed by DMA. We get a serial RS 232 output channel of high
 * throughput with a minimum of CPU interaction. It can be used by all three cores.\n
 *   Input is done by interrupt on a received character. The bandwidth of the input channel
 * is by far lower than the output. This is fine for the normal use case, controlling an
 * application by some input commands, but would become a problem if the intention is to
 * download large data amounts, e.g. for a kind of boot loader.\n
 *   Note, serial input is possible only from one core. Which core, is a compile time
 * configuration, see #INTC_IRQ_TARGET_CORE. Using the techniques from the implementation
 * of serial output for serial input, too, it would be possible to permit multi-core access
 * but it must be doubted that a reasonable use case exists and the implementation would
 * inherit the involved disadvantages (see sio_osWriteSerial() for details).\n
 *   The API is a small set of basic read and write routines, which adopt the conventions
 * of the C standard library so that the C functions for formatted output become usable.\n
 *   Note, the binding to the formatted output functions of the C library is not part of
 * this module.\n
 *   Note, formatted input is not possible through C standard functions.

       MCU reference manual PDF file. In Acrobat Reader, click View/Show/Hide/Navigation
       Panes/Attachments to find the Excel workbook.
         In the Excel workbook, on worksheet "IO Signal Table", each line refers to one of
       the possible functions of a port. The port is found in column A and most relevant
       are the settings "SIUL MSCR#" in column B, first line in the area of the given port,
       and "MSCR SSS" in column C. They designate the index of the MSCR register to use and
       the source selection, which is a major field of this register.
         The port has a fixed, hardwired, however chip-housing dependent one-by-one
       relation with a pin. This relation is found in columns O, P and Q.
         The source selection relates to the connection from an I/O device to the output
       buffer of the port. To connect an input of an I/O device with a port, a second
       source selection needs to be made, usually a port/pin but in a few cases is an
       alternate, internal device a possible source, too. (See RM 15.2.11, p. 388 and
       figure 15-2 on next page.) This requires the setting of field "IMCR SSS" in the
       other register array IMCR[]. The index into IMCR[] is found by search in the other
       worksheet "Input Muxing". Look for the port in question in column H or for the
       device to connect in column C. Column D holds the appropriate index into IMCR[].
         Note, the reference from worksheet "IO Signal Table" to worksheet "Input Muxing"
       is made by index of IMCR, too. In worksheet "IO Signal Table", in the sub-ordinated
       lines inside the area of the given port, column C, there is a second index stated
       for the input functions of a port. This index can be found in worksheet "Input
       Muxing" in column E in the line, we are looking for. For unclear reasons, this index
       plus 512 seems to be the index into the IMCR[] register array, too. For inputs, if
       we take worksheet "IO Signal Table", columns C and D, we could program IMCR.SSS
       without refering to the other worksheet. */

 * Principal API function for data output. A byte string is sent through the serial
 * interface. Actually, the bytes are queued for sending and the function is
 * non-blocking.\n
 *   The function can be called from any context on any core. However, it must not be
 * called untill function sio_osInitSerialInterface() has completed.
 *   @return
 * The number of queued bytes is returned. Normally, this is the same value as argument \a
 * noBytes. However, the byte sequence can be longer than the currently available space in
 * the send buffer. (Its size is fixed and no reallocation strategy is implemented.) The
 * tranmitted message will be truncated if the return value is less than function argument
 * \a noBytes.
 *   @param msg
 * The byte sequence to send. Note, this may be but is not necessarily a C string with zero
 * terminations. Zero bytes can be send, too.
 *   @param noBytes
 * The number of bytes to send. For a C string, this will mostly be \a strlen(msg).
 *   @remark
 * This function must be called by trusted code in supervisor mode only. It belongs to the
 * sphere of trusted code itself.
 *   @remark
 * The mutual exclusion of different contexts from entering this function is implemented
 * using a locally defined critical section object of type \a
 * mtx_intercoreCriticalSection_t. Such a critical will likely cause a deadlock if
 * intermingled with other critical sections. Therefore, this function must not be called
 * from inside of another intercore critical section. Call from a local critical section
 * implemented by suspension of interrupts is however permitted.
 *   @remark
 * The duration of the execution of the critical section is of order O(noBytes); a memcpy()
 * is applied to copy the message bytes into the output buffer. This can mean a significant
 * long time of suspension of interrupts on the invoking and the other cores. Moreover,
 * there's no fair arbitration and if one core makes frequent use of this function then
 * others may suffer from starvation.

 * The function reads a line of text from serial in and stores it into the string pointed

 * empty string if no such character has been received since system start or the previous
 * call of this function.\n
 *   Note, the latter condition means that the function is non-blocking - it doesn't wait
 * for further serial input.\n
 *   The end of line character, if found, is not copied into \a str. A terminating zero
 * character is automatically appended after the characters copied to \a str.\n
 *   The end of line character is a part of this module's compile time configuration, see
 * #SERIAL_INPUT_EOL. Standard for terminals is '\r', not '\n'. The other character out of
 * these two can or cannot be part of the copied line of text, see
 * #SERIAL_INPUT_FILTERED_CHAR. This, too, is a matter of compile time configuration.\n
 *   The function is not inter-core safe and must be called solely from execution contexts
 * running on core #INTC_IRQ_TARGET_CORE. It must not be called untill function
 * sio_osInitSerialInterface() has completed.
 *   @return
 * This function returns \a str on success, and NULL on error or if not enough characters
 * have been received meanwhile to form a complete line of text.\n
 *   Note the special situation of a full receive buffer without having received any end of
 * line character. The system would be stuck - later received end of line characters would
 * be discarded because of the full buffer and this function could never again return a
 * line of text. Therefore the function will return the complete buffer contents at once as
 * a line of input.
 *   @param str
 * This is the pointer to an array of chars where the C string is stored. \a str is the
 * empty string if the function returns NULL.
 *   @param sizeOfStr
 * The capacity of \a str in Byte. The maximum message length is one less since a
 * terminating zero character is always appended. A value of zero is caught by assertion.\n
 *   Note, if \a sizeOfStr is less than the line of text to be returned then the complete
 * line of text will nonetheless be removed from the receive buffer. Some characters from
 * the input stream would be lost.
 *   @remark
 * The serial interface is not restricted to text characters. If the source sends a zero
 * byte then this byte will be placed into the client's buffer \a str and it'll truncate
 * the message that is interpreted as C string.
 *   @remark
 * This function is a mixture of C lib's \a gets and \a fgets: Similar to \a gets it
 * doesn't put the end of line character into the result and similar to \a fgets it
 * respects the size of the receiving buffer.
 *   @remark 
 * Both, no data available yet and an empty input line of text return the same, empty C
 * string in \a str, but they differ in function return code, which is NULL or \a str,
 * respectively.
 *   @remark
 * On buffer overrun, i.e. if the client code didn't invoke this function fast enough, an
 * end of line won't be written into the internal receive buffer and the truncated line
 * will be silently concatenated with its successor. You may consider observing the global
 * variable \a sio_serialInLostBytes to recognize this situation. Note, because of the race
 * conditions between serial I/O interrupt and application software you can not clearly
 * relate a change of these variables to a particular message you get from this function.
 * In particular, you must not try to reset the counter prior to a read operation in order
 * to establish such a relation. Your application will just know that there is some garbled
 * input.
 *   @remark
 * This function must be called by trusted code in supervisor mode only. It belongs to the
 * sphere of trusted code itself.
