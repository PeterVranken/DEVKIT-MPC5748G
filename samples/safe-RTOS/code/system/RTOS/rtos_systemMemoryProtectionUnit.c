/**
 * @file rtos_systemMemoryProtectionUnit.c
 * Configuration and initialization of the Memory Protection Unit (MPU). The
 * configuration is chosen static in this sample. The initially chosen configuration is
 * never changed during run-time.\n
 *   The configuration uses a descriptor for all ROM, which is occupied by the compiled
 * code: All processes have read and execution access. Write access, although it can't do
 * any harm is forbidden: According run-time failure reporting will point to definite
 * implementation errors.\n
 *   The configuration has one descriptor for all RAM, which is occupied by the compiled
 * code. All processes have read access and only the OS process has write and execute
 * access, too.\n
 *   The configuration has one descriptor for the entire peripheral address space. The OS
 * process has read and write access.\n
 *   Each of the four user processes has three descriptors, all of them for RAM write and
 * execute access. There's a descriptor for the initialized data and bss, one for the small
 * data and bss and one for the small data 2 and bss 2.\n
 *   The configuration has one descriptor for a chunk of memory, which all user processes
 * have read and write access to. This memory is meant for inter-process communication and
 * must evidently never be used to hold data, which is essential for the health of a
 * process and in particular for the process, that implements supervisory safety tasks.\n
 *   The static configuration of the MPU is the explanation for the fixed number of four
 * supported processes (#RTOS_NO_PROCESSES). For the partitioning of the RAM space, we need
 * three descriptors per user process and one for the OS and we have 16 descriptors
 * available. From the remaining three, we have spend one for shared data. Two descriptors
 * are still available.\n
 *   CAUTION: The mentioned memory chunks or areas are puzzled by the linker. The MPU
 * configuration makes no hard coded assumptions about memory arrangement and distribution
 * or addresses and sizes of the chunks. It reads address and length of the memory chunks
 * from linker provided symbols. Insofar do we have a very tight relationship between the
 * implementation of this module and the linker script, which must be obeyed when doing
 * maintenance work at either side.
 *
 * Alternative configurations, which may find their use case and do not break the safety
 * concept:
 *   - The OS process doesn't necessarily need execution access for RAM. There
 * are typically driver implementation patterns, which require RAM execution rights, but it
 * is mostly about initialization and could be done prior to calling the MPU configuration.\n
 *   - The user processes won't normally need execution rights for their RAM\n
 *   - It is possible to let a process with higher privileges have access to the memories
 * of all processes with lower privileges. Below, it is explained how to do this\n
 *   - If the number of processes is reduced (a safety concept requires two processes at
 * minimum) then each process could have up to six descriptors. This would enable a
 * configuration with disjunct small data and bss chunks so that the waste of data image
 * ROM disappears, which the current configuration has (see linker script for details)\n
 *   - The shared memory section can be disabled if not required for the inter-process
 * communication\n
 *   - A fifth process could be defined using the unused descriptors. Most code barely
 * makes use of SDA2 and since we mostly use explicit data object placing it's definitely
 * not essential. This way it would even be possible to define up to seven processes, each
 * using two descriptors.\n
 *   - A difficult topic is the placing of the small data 2 and bss 2 sections. It is
 * possible to locate them into the ROM. This is likely not fully compliant with the EABI
 * but for all normal embedded applications alright. In which case we had four free
 * descriptors and could implement two more processes. A similar concept for increasing the
 * number of processes would be entirely switching off the short addressing modes. This is a
 * matter of the compiler command line

    /* All regions grant the same access to all relevant bus masters. The access word (we
       use format 1) has two bits for each master which form the index to select one out of
       three possible combinations of read/write/execute right for supervisor and user mode.
       For RAM (protected by SMPU_1) we use three access right patterns:
         - rwx for SV and r for U       (all used RAM and for all user processes)
         - rwx for SV and rwx for U     (process owned RAM, decided by PID)
         - rwx for SV and rw for U      (shared RAM and for all user processes)
       For ROM and peripherals (protected by SMPU_1) we need:
         - rx for SV and for U          (all used ROM)
         - rw for SV, no access for U   (peripherals)
         The access pattern is defined by six bits in this order: SVR, SVW, SVX, UR, UW,
       UX.
         Masters 0 .. 15 are ordered from left to right, i.e. from most to least
       significant. The relevant masters are the three cores and DMA: M0, M1, M2, M4, M8,
       M9, M10. In this sample, we don't use the other bus masters (security core and
       certain I/O devices) and for now, they don't get access.
         Remark: We use two overlapping regions for most RAM. One spawns all of the RAM and
       grants read access to anybody (and write access to OS code), the other ones relate
       to small areas, which grant write access to one of the processes. This technique
       makes it difficult to get cache inhibitted RAM: The large global read access area
       must of course not disable the cache and -- since CI=1 has lower priority than CI=0
       (see RM 21.4.2, p. 506) -- this can't be altered by the overlapping area. To provide
       cached and uncached RAM we split the large global read area into two MPU areas. */

       break points in the debugger at critical code points and will not happen in normal
       code execution. A critical point was a breakpoint at the beginning of the IVOR #1
       handler. The MPU protection exception was followed by an immediate second one, when
       the breakpoint was hit; an instruction read at 0xffffc004 was tried but rejected by
       the MPU (peripheral space has no execution access rights). This immediate second
       exception destroyed the MCSRRi registers and disable code continuation after the

       supervisor mode. The processes running in user mode still don't get any access. This

/**
 * Helper function, mainly intended to support safe system call handler implementation:
 * Check if a pointer value is valid for writing in the context of a given process.\n
 *   A system call handler must never trust a user code provided pointer; evidently not for
 * write access but not even for read operation (a read into the address space of
 * peripherals can have a side effect). The user code could make the system call handler
 * overwrite some non-process owned data objects, cause an access violation in the
 * supervisor code or manipulate some peripherals.\n
 *   Normally, it's strongly disencouraged having pointers as arguments of system calls at
 * all. If not avoidable, one can use this helper function to check that a pointer points
 * into permitted address space and that all bytes of a data object pointed at are still in
 * that address space. Here for write access.\n
 *   Permitted address space is anywhere, where the process may write without causing an
 * exception or any kind of side effect. In particular, this means the process' own RAM and
 * the shared RAM.
 *   @return
 * Get \a true if the pointer may be used for write access and \a false otherwise.
 *   @param PID
 * The ID of the process the query relates to. Range is 1..4.
 *   @param address
 * The pointer value, or the beginning of the chunk of memory, which needs to be entirely
 * located in writable memory.
 *   @param noBytes
 * The size of the chunk of memory to be checked. Must not be less than one. (Checked by
 * assertion).
 *   @remark
 * The counterpart function rtos_checkUserCodeReadPtr() is implemented as inline function
 * in the RTOS API header file, rtos.h.
 *   @remark
 * Although this function is intended for use inside a system call handler it can be safely
 * used from user code, too.
