/**
 * This function can be used to install an interrupt service for a given I/O device
 * and a given core. It will also set the Priority Select Register for the I/O device's
 * IRQ to the desired value.
 *   @param pInterruptHandler
 * The interrupt service routine by reference. An ordinary C function in the user code area,
 * which is called when the according interrupt is served.
 *   @param processorID
 * The interrupt is assigned to the processor of this ID. Allowed are: 0 for Z4A, 1 for Z4B
 * or 2 for Z2.\n
 *   Note, the implementation avoids having different vector tables for the three cores.
 * The work assumption is that an I/O interrupt will normally be served by either one or
 * another core. The INTC HW permits signalling any interrupt to any set of cores. Both
 * statements are combined in that setting an interrupt vector to a core A will cause an
 * assertion if the same interrupt had been registered already before for another core B
 * and the registration for A had specified another interrupt service routine.\n
 *   In the rare case of needing one interrupt on different cores the ISR needs
 * to query the processor ID so that the implementation of the handler can become
 * processor dependent.
 *   @param vectorNum
 * All possible external interrupt sources are hardwired to the interrupt controller. They
 * are indentified by index. The table, which interrupt source (mostly I/O device) is
 * connected to the controller at which index can be found in the MCU reference manual,
 * section 23.1.2, table 23-1, p. 523ff.
 *   @param psrPriority
 * The priority at which the interrupt is served. Range is 0..15, checked by assertion. 0
 * is useless, it would never be served, 1 is the lowest real priority and 15 the highest.
 * Preemption of a handler (if enabled), which serves an interrupt of priority n will be
 * possible only by another interrupt of priority n+1 or higher.
 *   @param isPreemptable
 * For each interrupt it can be said, whether it is preemptable by other interrupts of
 * higher priority or not. If this is \a false then the interrupt handler will always be
 * entered with the status bit EE reset in the machine status register MSR of the servicing
 * core.\n
 *   Note, a handler, which has been declared non-premptable is allowed to set the EE bit
 * itself. It can thus first do some operations without any race-conditions with other
 * interrupts and then continue without further locking normal interrupt processing.
 *   @remark
 * The function can be used at any time. It is possible to exchange a handler at run-time,
 * while interrrupts are being processed, but only on the processor, which invokes this
 * function. However, the normal use case will rather be to call this function for all
 * required interrupts and only then call the other function inc_resumeAllInterrupts() on
 * all the processors.\n
 *   This function must not be called for an interrupt vector number n from within an ISR
 * of that interrupt vector number and it must not be called from processor i for processor
 * j!=i, if that processor is running.
 *   @remark
 * On an MPC5748G, all cores share the function code. A core should use this function to
 * install its ISRs, regardless whether or not it runs the RTOS. A typical scenario
 * would be running the RTOS only on one core, but the others should still use this
 * function to install their ISRs.
 *   @remark
 * This function must be called from supervisor mode only.
