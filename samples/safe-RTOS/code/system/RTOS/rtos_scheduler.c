/**
 * @file rtos_scheduler.c
 * This file implements a simple yet "safe" Real Time Operating System (RTOS) for the
 * MPC5643L.\n
 *   The RTOS offers a strictly priority controlled scheduler. The user code is organized
 * in processes and tasks. Any task belongs to one of the processes. Different processes
 * have different privileges. The concept is to use the process with highest privileges for
 * the safety tasks.\n
 *   A task is activated by an event; an application will repeatedly use the API
 * rtos_osCreateEvent() to define the conditions or points in time, when the tasks have to
 * become due.\n
 *   Prior to the start of the scheduler (and thus prior to the beginning of the
 * pseudo-parallel, concurrent execution of the tasks) all later used tasks are registered
 * at the scheduler; an application will repeatedly use the APIs rtos_osRegisterUserTask()
 * and rtos_osRegisterOSTask().\n
 *   After all needed tasks are registered the application will start the RTOS' kernel
 * by calling the API rtos_osInitKernel() and task scheduling begins.\n
 *   A task is mainly characterized by the owning process, the task function and a
 * priority; the C code function is invoked in the context of the process and at given
 * priority level when the task is activated. The function is executed either until the
 * task function is left or the task function or one of its sub-routines requests task
 * termination by means of a system call or the task function is aborted by an exception.\n
 *   "Context of a process" mainly relates to the memory management concept. Any process
 * has its private memory. This memory is either write-accessible only for the owning
 * process or for the owning process and all other processes with higher privileges. The
 * "or" in this statement is a matter of project configuration. A few more elements are
 * process dependent; many system calls are restricted to processes of sufficient
 * privileges.\n
 *   "Activated" does still not necessarily mean executing for a task; the more precise
 * wording is that the activation makes a task immediately and unconditionally "ready"
 * (i.e. ready for execution). If more than a single task are ready at a time then the
 * function of the task with higher priority is executed first and the function of the
 * other task will be served only after completion of the first. Several tasks can be
 * simultaneously ready and one of them will be executed, this is the one and only
 * "running" task.\n
 *   "Are ready at a time" does not necessarily mean that both tasks have been activated at
 * the same point in time. If task A of priority Pa is activated first and as only task
 * then it'll be executed regardless of its priority. If task B of priority Pb is activated
 * later, but still before A has completed then we have two tasks which have been activated
 * "at a time". The priority relation decides what happens:\n
 *   If Pa >= Pb then A is completed and B will be started and executed only after A has
 * completed.\n
 *   If Pb > Pa then task A turns from state running back to state ready and B becomes the
 * running task until it completes. Now A as remaining ready, yet uncompleted task
 * becomes the running task again and it can complete.\n
 *   With other words, if a task is activated and it has a higher priority than the running
 * task then it'll preempt the running task and it'll become the running task itself.\n
 *   If no task is ready at all then the scheduler continues the original code thread,
 * which is the code thread starting in function main() and which first registers the tasks
 * and then starts the kernel. (Everything in this code thread, which is placed behind
 * the call of API rtos_osInitKernel() is called the "idle task".)\n
 *   The implemented scheduling scheme leads to a strictly hierarchical execution order of
 * tasks. This scheme is sometimes referred to as scheduling of tasks of Basic Conformance
 * Class (BCC). It's simple, less than what most RTOSs offer, but still powerful enough for
 * the majority of industrial use cases.\n
 * Basic conformance class means that a task cannot suspend intentionally and ahead of
 * its normal termination. Once started, it needs to be entirely executed. Due to the
 * strict priority scheme it'll temporarily suspend only for sake of tasks of higher
 * priority (but not voluntarily or on own desire). Another aspect of the same is that the
 * RTOS doesn't know task to task events -- such events are usually the way intentional
 * suspension and later resume of tasks is implemented.\n
 *   The activation of a task can be done by software, using API function
 * rtos_osTriggerEvent() or rtos_triggerEvent() or it can be done by the scheduler on a
 * regular time base. In the former case the task is called an event task, the latter is a
 * cyclic task with fixed period time.\n
 *   The RTOS implementation is tightly connected to the implementation of interrupt
 * services. Interrupt services, e.g. to implement I/O operations for the tasks, are
 * registered with rtos_osRegisterInterruptHandler(). There are a few services, which are
 * available to ISRs:
 *   - An ISR may use rtos_osEnterCriticalSection()/rtos_osLeaveCriticalSection(),
 * rtos_osSuspendAllInterrupts()/rtos_osResumeAllInterrupts() or
 * rtos_osSuspendAllInterruptsByPriority()/rtos_osResumeAllInterruptsByPriority() to shape
 * critical sections with other ISRs or with OS tasks, which are based on interrupt locks
 * and which are highly efficient. (Note, safety concerns forbid having an API to shape a
 * critical section between ISRs and user tasks)
 *   - An ISR may use rtos_osTriggerEvent() to trigger an event. The associated tasks will
 * be scheduled after returning from the interrupt (and from any other interrupt it has
 * possibly preempted)
 *   - An ISR may use rtos_osRunTask to implement a callback into another process. The
 * callback is run under the constraints of the target process and can therefore be
 * implemented as part of the application(s) in that process and still without breaking the
 * safety concept
 *
 * Safety:\n
 *   The RTOS is based on the "unsafe" counterpart published at
 * https://github.com/PeterVranken/TRK-USB-MPC5643L/tree/master/LSM/RTOS-VLE. Most
 * explanations given there still hold. There are two major differences:\n
 *   In this project, we have replaced the hardware scheduler with a scheduler implemented
 * in software. The behavior is nearly identical and the performance penalty is little in
 * comparison to the advantage of now having an unlimited number of events, priorities and
 * tasks.\n
 *   The second modification is the added safety concept. Such a concept starts with a
 * specification of what we expect from a "safe" RTOS:\n
 *   "If the implementation of a task, which is meant the supervisory or safety task, is
 * itself free of faults then the RTOS shall guarantee that this task is correctly and
 * timely executed regardless of whatever imaginable failures are made by any other
 * process."\n
 *   This requirement serves at the same time as the definition of the term "safe", when
 * used in the context of this RTOS. safe-RTOS promises no more than this requirement says.
 * As a consequence, a software made with this RTOS is not necessarily safe and even if it
 * is then the system using that software is still not necessarily safe.\n
 *   The implementation uses the CPU's "problem state" in conjunction with exception
 * handlers and memory protection to meet the requirement.
 *   More details can be found at
 * https://github.com/PeterVranken/TRK-USB-MPC5643L/tree/master/LSM/safe-RTOS-VLE#3-the-safety-concept.

 * Any (normal) task is activated by an event and a task without related event is useless.
 * This call associates the registered task with an already created event. See

 * #EVENT_ID_INIT_TASK. It is allowed not to register an init task for a process or
 * for the OS but it is not possible to register more than one (or to re-register an) init
 * task for a given process or the OS.\n
 *   The order of registration of several tasks with one and the same event matters. The
 * tasks will be acivated in order of registration whenever the event becomes due or is
 * triggered by software.\n
 *   The order of registration doesn't matter for initialization tasks! The OS
 * initialization task is served first. Processes are always initialized in order of rising
 * process ID. The most privileged process is served last and can thus override descisions
 * of its less privileged predecessors.
 *   @param addrTaskFct
 * The task function, which is run in process \a PID every time, the event \a idEvent
 * triggers.
 *   @param PID
 *   The process the task belongs to by identifier. We have a fixed, limited number of four
 * processes (#RTOS_NO_PROCESSES) plus the kernel process, which has ID 0. The range of
 * process IDs to be used here is 0 .. #RTOS_NO_PROCESSES.\n
 *   @param tiTaskMaxInUs
 * Time budget for the user task in Microseconds. This budget is granted for each
 * activation of the task, i.e. each run of \a addrTaskFct(). The budget relates to
 * deadline monitoring, i.e. it is a world time budget, not an execution time budget.\n
 *   Deadline monitoring is supported up to a maximum execution time of
 * #RTOS_TI_DEADLINE_MAX_IN_US Microseconds.\n
 *   A value of zero means that deadline monitoring is disabled for the task.\n
 *   There's no deadline monitoring for OS tasks. If \a PID is zero then \a
 * tiTaskMaxInUS meeds to be zero, too.

 * Never call this function after the call of rtos_osInitKernel()!

/**
 * Creation of an event. The event can be cyclically triggering or software triggered.
 * An event is needed to activate a user task. Therefore, any reasonable application will
 * create at least one event.\n
 *   This function is repeatedly called by the application code for each required event.
 * All calls of this function need to be done prior to the start of the kernel using
 * rtos_osInitKernel().\n
 *   @return
 * \a rtos_err_noError (zero) if the event could be created. The maximum number of events
 * is limited to #RTOS_MAX_NO_EVENTS by hardware constraints. If the event cannot be
 * created due to this constraint or if the event descriptor contains invalid data then
 * then the function returns a non zero value from enumeration \a rtos_errorCode_t.\n
 *   An assertion in the calling code is considered appropriate to handle the error because
 * it'll always be a static configuration error.
 *   @param pEventId
 * All events are identified by a positive integer. Normally this ID is returned by
 * reference in * \a pEventId. If the event cannot be created then #RTOS_INVALID_EVENT_ID
 * is returned in * \a pEventId.\n
 *   Note, it is guaranteed to the caller that the returned ID is not an arbitrary,
 * meaningless number. Instead, the ID is counted from zero in order of creating events.
 * The first call of this function will return 0, the second 1, and so on. This simplifies
 * ID handling in the application code, constants can mostly be applied as the IDs are
 * effectively known at compile time.
 *   @param tiCycleInMs
 * The period time for regularly triggering events in ms.\n
 *   The permitted range is 0..2^30-1. 0 means no regular, timer controlled trigger and the
 * event is only enabled for software trigger using rtos_triggerEvent() (permitted for
 * interrupts or other tasks).
 *   @param tiFirstActivationInMs
 * The first trigger of the event in ms after start of kernel. The permitted range is
 * 0..2^30-1.\n
 *   Note, this setting is useless if a cycle time zero in \a tiCycleInMs specifies a non
 * regular event. \a tiFirstActivationInMs needs to be zero in this case, too.
 *   @param priority
 * The priority of the event in the range 1..UINT_MAX. Different events can share the same
 * priority. The priority of an event is the priority of all associated tasks at the same
 * time. The execution of tasks, which share the priority will be serialized when they are
 * activated at same time or with overlap.\n
 *   Note the safety constraint that task priorities above #RTOS_MAX_LOCKABLE_TASK_PRIORITY
 * are available only to events, which solely have tasks associated that belong to the
 * process with highest process ID in use.\n
 *   Note, the order in which events are created can affect the priority in a certain
 * sense. If two events are created with same priority and when they at runtime become due
 * at the same OS time tick then the earlier created event will trigger its associated user
 * tasks before the later ceated event.
 *   @param minPIDToTriggerThisEvent
 * An event can be triggered by user code, using rtos_triggerEvent(). However, tasks
 * belonging to less privileged processes must not generally have permission to trigger
 * events that may activate tasks of higher privileged processes. Since an event is not
 * process related, we make the minimum process ID, which is required to trigger this
 * event, an explicitly configured property of the event.\n
 *   Only tasks belonging to a process with PID >= \a minPIDToTriggerThisEvent are
 * permitted to trigger this event.\n
 *   The range of \a minPIDToTriggerThisEvent is 0 ... (#RTOS_NO_PROCESSES+1). 0 and 1 both
 * mean, all processes may trigger the event, (#RTOS_NO_PROCESSES+1) means only OS code can
 * trigger the event. (#RTOS_NO_PROCESSES+1) is available as
 * #RTOS_EVENT_NOT_USER_TRIGGERABLE, too.
 *   @param taskParam
 * The event is used to trigger its associated tasks. An argument can be passed to the task
 * functions, when they are called later. The initial value of this argument is set now.\n
 *   Actually, the relevance of this initial value is little. It'll be used mainly for
 * regular, time triggered tasks, but for these tasks, the task parameter will mostly (not
 * always) be meaningless and event tasks will receive a specific argument, which is
 * defined when triggering the event they are associated with. See rtos_triggerEvent() for
 * more details.
 *   @remark
 * Never call this function after the call of rtos_osInitKernel()!
 *   @remark
 * This function must be called by trusted code in supervisor mode only.

         processes. The execution of these callbacks will be inhibited
       - Initialize the memory protection. This needs to be done before the very first user
         mode task function has the chance to become started. (The very first user mode task
         functions need to be the process initialization tasks.)
       - Disable the scheduler to trigger any events (which is its initial state).
         Triggering events would not cause any user tasks to execute (processes still
         disabled) but their due counters would already run and the configured startup
         conditions would not be met later when enabling the processes
       - Globally enable interrupt processing. I/O drivers and OS clock tick are running.
         This is a prerequisite for the deadline monitoring, which we want to have in place
         already for the init tasks
       - Sequentially execute all configured process initialization tasks. There are no
         crosswise race condition and nor with user tasks or I/O driver callbacks. Note,
         interrupts are already running and cause race conditions. Moreover, they could
         make use of rtos_osTriggerEvent() and if an OS task is associated with the
         triggered event then there would be race conditions with this OS task, too

 *   This function can be called from any OS task or ISR. However, if the calling task

 * higher than the activating task is activated by the triggered event then the activating
 * task is immediately preempted to the advantage of the activated task. Otherwise the
 * activated task is chained and executed after the activating task.
 *   @return
 * There is no activation queuing. Consequently, triggering the event can fail if at least

 *   The value is ignored if the function returns \a false.
 *   @remark
 * The function is indented to start a non cyclic task by application software trigger but
 * can be applied to cyclic tasks, too. In which case the task function of the cyclic task
 * would be invoked once additionally. Note, that an event activation loss is not unlikely in
 * this case; the cyclic task may currently be busy.
 *   @remark
 * It may look like an inconsistent API design if all associated tasks receive the same

 * which provides an individual value to each associated task. The only reason not to do
 * so is the additional overhead in combination with the very few imaginable use cases.

 *   @remark
 * If \a idEvent addresses a regular, time triggered event and if triggering succeeds, then

    /* This function and particularly this loop is the essence of the task scheduler. There
       are some tricky details to be understood.
         This function is called as a kind of "on-exit-hook" of any interrupt, which makes
       use of the rtos_osTriggerEvent() service. (Actually, this includes user tasks, which
       run the software interrupt rtos_triggerEvent().) It looks for the triggered event
       and runs the associated tasks if it has a priority higher then the priority of the
       currently running task.
         The operation looks uncomplicated for an event of higher priority. We acknowledge
       the event and run the tasks. Looking for and acknowleding means a read-modify-write
       operation and since the events can at any time be accessed by interrupts of higher
       priority we need a critical section for this.
         First complexity is an interrupt, which sets another event while we are processing
       the tasks of the first one. If this has in turn a higher priority then it's no new
       consideration but just a matter of recursive invocation of this same function.
       However, if it has a priority lower than that of the currently processed event and
       tasks, then we (and not the preempting context, which triggers the event) are
       obliged to run the tasks of this event, too, but - because of the lower priority -
       only later, after the current set of tasks. (Note, "later", there is no
       HW/SW-interrupt any more to get the new event be processed - so we need a loop here
       to not forget that event.) The tricky thing is how to span the critical sections:
         If we find the first event (searching from highest towards lower priorities) then
       we apply the CS just to acknowledge the event. (I.e. no potential later, recursive
       invocation of this function will compete in handling it.) When done with all the
       tasks of the event we release the event. We change the status from "in progress" to
       "idle" - of course again in a CS. However, this CS must now be merged with the CS at
       the beginning of the next cycle, the CS to acknowledge the next found event. The
       reason why:
         As soon as we release an event, it can be set again and in particular before we
       have left this function and killed its stack frame (a stack frame of significant
       size as this function still is element of an ISR). The newly set event would mean a
       recursive call of this function, so another stack frame for the same event. The same
       could then happen to the recursice function invocation and so forth - effectively
       there were no bounds anymore for the stack consumption, which is a fatal risk.
       Merging the CSs for releasing event A and acknowledging event B (of lower priority)
       means that the stack frame of this invokation is inherited by the next processed
       event B before a recursive call can process the next occurance of A. Which is
       alright; this leads to the pattern that there can be outermost one stack frame per
       event priority and this is the possible minimum.
         The same consideration requires that the CS for the final event release must not
       be left before return from the function. Return from the function still means
       several instructions until the stack frame is killed and event setting in this phase
       is just the same as outlined for the loop cycle-to-cycle situation. Actually, the
       final CS must not be ended before the stack frame has been killed, effectively at
       the very end of the ISR, with the rfi instruction.
         Another consideration makes it useful that we are already inside the first
       acknowledge-CS when entering the function. This CS includes the decision (in
       triggerEvenet), whether or not a recursive scheduler call is required. Being here,
       and because of the CS, this information is still coherent with the events' state. We
       can place some assertions, the behavior is more transparent and the implementation
       more reliable. Without an CS we could see this: Event A is set and makes this
       scheduler invoked. Event B can be triggered before tbhe scheduler finds the due
       event. It is preempted by a recursive scheduler invocation. The preempting scheduler
       would handle both events, B first then A. After the preemption the event A is no
       longer due and the scheduler would have to return without doing anything. Which is
       neither a problem nor an advantage (same overall effort and timing), but there are
       less invariants for checking. Note, this is still an option if minimizing the CS
       is rated higher than transparency of behavior. */

               (If we wouldn't allow same priorities then this condition was implicitly
               fulfilled and we could always advance with the next event in order, which is
               surely of lower priority.)
                 Note, this consideration leads to the repeated check of the same events.
               Example: A and B were events of same priority and appear in the list in this
               order. Event A can be triggered while event B is being proceessed. We must
               check A before we check the successor of B, e.g. C, which has lower
               priority. While running the tasks of A, event B can have been triggered
               again, and so on. In an extreme situation, we would infinitly loop and
               alternatingly process A and B, but C would never been visited and suffer
               from starvation. (Easy to get: A task of A triggers event B and a task of B
               triggers event A.)
                 After we have served an event of priority n, we check the first event of
               this priority n as next one. All event specifications, inlcuding priorities,
               are staical and we have prepared a link from each event to the first in list
               order, which has the same priority but which is not the event itself.
               Examples:
               - A, B, C have prio n, D is the successor of C with prio n-1:
                 - A is linked to B
                 - B and C are linked to A
                 - D is linked to its successor
               - A has prio n, B has prio n-1, C has prio n-2:
                 - A is linked to B
                 - B is linked to C
                 - C is linked to its successor
                 Note, this scheme doesn't lead to a fair round robin for groups of events
               with same priority but this is not a contradiction with the meaning of
               priorities or priority based scheduling. */

 * Priority ceiling protocol (PCP), partial scheduler lock: All tasks up to the specified

 * implementing mutual exclusion of sub-sets of tasks.\n
 *   Note, the use of the other function pairs\n
 *   - rtos_osEnterCriticalSection() and\n
 *   - rtos_osLeaveCriticalSection()\n
 * or\n
 *   - rtos_osSuspendAllInterrupts() and\n
 *   - rtos_osResumeAllInterrupts()\n
 * locks all interrupt processing and no other task (or interrupt handler) can become
 * active while the task is inside the critical section code. With respect to behavior,
 * using the PCP API is much better: Call this function with the highest priority of all
 * tasks, which should be locked, i.e. which compete for the resource or critical section
 * to protect. This may still lock other, non competing tasks, but at least all interrupts
 * and all non competing tasks of higher priority will be served.\n
 *   The major drawback of using the PCP instead of the interrupt lock API is the
 * significantly higher expense; particularly at the end of the critical section, when
 * resuming the scheduling again: A recursive call of the scheduler is required to see if
 * some tasks of higher priority had become ready during the lock time. Therefore, locking
 * the interrupts is likely the better choice for very short critical sections.\n
 *   To release the protected resource or to leave the critical section, call the
 * counterpart function rtos_osResumeAllTasksByPriority(), which restores the original
 * task priority level.
 *   @return
 * The task priority level at entry into this function (and into the critical section) is
 * returned. This level needs to be restored on exit from the critical section using
 * rtos_osResumeAllTasksByPriority().
 *   @param suspendUpToThisTaskPriority
 * All tasks up to and including this priority will be locked, i.e. they won't be executed
 * even if they'd become ready. The CPU will not handle them until the priority level is
 * lowered again.
 *   @remark
 * The critical section shaped with this API from an OS task guarantees mutual exclusion
 * with critical section code shaped with the other API rtos_suspendAllTasksByPriority()
 * from a user code task.
 *   @remark
 * To support the use case of nested calls of OSEK/VDX like GetResource/ReleaseResource
 * functions, this function compares the stated value to the current priority level. If \a
 * suspendUpToThisTaskPriority is less than the current value then the current value is not
 * altered. The function still returns the current value and the calling code doesn't need
 * to take care: It can unconditionally end a critical section with
 * rtos_osResumeAllTasksByPriority() stating the returned priority level value. (The
 * resume function will have no effect in this case.) This makes the OSEK like functions
 * usable without deep inside or full transparency of the priority levels behind the scene;
 * just use the pairs of Get-/ResumeResource, be they nested or not.
 *   @remark
 * The use of this function to implement critical sections is usually quite static. For any
 * protected entity (usually a data object or I/O device) the set of competing tasks
 * normally is a compile time known. The priority level to set for entry into the critical
 * section is the maximum of the priorities of all tasks in the set. The priority level to
 * restore on exit from the critical section is the priority of the calling task. All of
 * this static knowledge would typically be put into encapsulating macros that actually
 * invoke this function. (OSEK/VDX like environments would use this function pair to
 * implement the GetResource/ReleaseResource concept.)
 *   @remark
 * Any change of the current priority level made with this function needs to be undone
 * using rtos_osResumeAllTasksByPriority() and still inside the same task. It is not
 * possible to consider this function a mutex, which can be acquired in one task activation
 * and which can be released in an arbitrary later task activation or from another task.\n
 *   Moreover, different to the user mode variant of the PCP function pair, there is no
 * restoration of the current priority level at task termination time.\n
 *   An assertion in the scheduler will likely fire if the two PCP APIs are not properly
 * used in pairs.
 *   @remark
 * This function must be called from OS tasks only. Any attempt to use it from either an
 * ISR or in user mode code will lead to either a failure or privileged exception,
 * respectively.
 *   @remark
