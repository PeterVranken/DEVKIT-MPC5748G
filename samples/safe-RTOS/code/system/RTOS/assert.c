/**
 * @file assert.c
 * The C standard macro assert is in case of GCC for PowerPC implemented by an external
 * function. This leaves it open, how the target platform should behave when an assertion
 * fires. This module implements the wanted behavior as a system call for the RTOS.

       instructions for continuing the calling function. Instead, we place an infinite loop
       here. The promise to continue the SW execution is held in this way:
         The user task spins in the loop either forever or until a specified time budget is
       exhausted. In either case, the problem is reported by the kernel. Forever spinning
       is reported as activation losses of the according event, time budget exhausted as
       process error #RTOS_ERR_PRC_DEADLINE. Anyway, kernel and the tasks of higher
       priority are not impacted. */
