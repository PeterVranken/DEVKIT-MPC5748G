/**
 * @file gsl_systemLoad.c
 *   Measure the current CPU load produced by the application code. A support function for
 * the use with the PowerPC RTOS.
 *   @see uint8_t gsl_osGetSystemLoad(void)
 *
 * This file is an adoption from the Arduino RTOS RTuinOS. The original file has been
 * downloaded from https://svn.code.sf.net/p/rtuinos/code/trunk/code/RTOS/gsl_systemLoad.c
 * on Nov 15, 2017.\n
 *   The major difference of this implementation to the original RTuinOS source is the
 * change to the native 32 Bit data type for the calculations. The Arduino function
 * delayMicroseconds() has been replaced by the PowerPC substitute del_delayMicroseconds().

/** The function of this module is based on the exactely known execution time of a delay
    function. If this macro is set to one then the actual execution time of this function
    is measured and reported (to the debugger). The acutal delay can then be tuned based on
    the results. The CPU load result is invalid in this case and the normal setting for
    this define will be zero.
      @remark Caution, if calibration mode is on then the function is no longer reentrant,
    but it is usually run on more than one core at a time. The core will overwrite one
    another's results.

/**
 * A diagnostic function, which can be used to estimate the current system load. The
 * function executes some test code of known CPU execution time and relates this known time
 * to the measured, actually elapsed world time. The function needs to be called from the
 * idle task only. Now the mentioned ratio is a measure for the system load: The lesser the
 * system idles the longer it'll take to execute the test code.\n
 *   On principal, the execution time of the function depends on the system load and can
 * raise to infinite if the load approaches 100%. This effect is lowered by splitting the
 * test code in pieces and ending the measurement if enough pieces have been executed to
 * get the desired resolution. Nonetheless, the effect remains and no upper boundary can
 * be given for the execution time of this function if the system load is close to 100%.\n
 *   Normally, the execution time of this function is about 1 second. This long time is
 * needed to have a sufficient averaging effect; typically the CPU consumption by the tasks
 * is quite irregular due to the complex task activation pattern of the scheduler. The
 * averaging time can be changed at compile time, please see macro #TI_WINDOW_LEN_MS.
 *   @return
 * The system load is returned with a resolution 0.1%, i.e. as an integer number in the
 * range 0..1000.
 *   @remark
 * The function execution takes a long time (above 1s). It must only be called from the
 * idle task and only if there are no other essential jobs for the idle task.
 *   @remark
 * The function will never return if the CPU load is 100% and it might take an arbitrary
 * long time to return if it is close to 100%. The calling code must anticipate this, e.g.
 * by presetting the result variable with 100% prior to calling this function.
 *   @remark
 * If the idle task contains other code besides repeatedly calling this function, then the
 * execution time of that code is not considered by the measurement, it does not contribute
 * to the returned CPU load result.
