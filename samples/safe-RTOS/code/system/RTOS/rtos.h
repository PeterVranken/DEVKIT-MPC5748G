/** The number of configured processes per core.\n
      Although it looks like a matter of application dependent configuration, this is a
    fixed setting in our RTOS. We have the HW constraint of a limited number of memory
    region descriptors in MMU and MPU. Four processes can be comfortably supported with
    enough descriptors each. Having less regions per process is possible with reduced
    programming comfort and so we could have more processes even without changing the
    run-time code (i.e. implementation of dynamic change of regions). However, the aimed
    use cases of this RTOS, applications with higher safety integrity level, can be handled
    with two or three processes so that pre-configured four should always be fine.\n
      The big advantage of having a fixed number of processes is the avoidance of
    configuration changes. The MMU and MPU configuration would need changes on C code level
    and the linker script would need more or altered section filters.\n
      No using all pre-configured processes doesn't matter. Just use a process in a task
    specification or leave it. An unused process doesn't produce any overhead. */

 *   Safety rationale: A user task cannot shape a critical section with the RTOS scheduler,
 * nor with the user task of priority above #RTOS_MAX_LOCKABLE_TASK_PRIORITY and nor with
 * an ISR. (The attempt to shape a critical section with a task above

 * Get the task priority level at entry into this function (and into the critical section).
 * This priority level needs to be restored on exit from the critical section using system
 * call rtos_resumeAllTasksByPriority().
 *   @param suspendUpToThisPriority
 * \a suspendUpToThisPriority is the aimed task priority level. All tasks up to and
 * including this priority will be locked. They won't get the CPU until the priority level
 * is lowered again.
 *   @remark
 * The critical section shaped with this API from an user mode task guarantees mutual
 * exclusion with critical section code shaped with the other API
 * rtos_osSuspendAllTasksByPriority() from an OS task.
 *   @remark
 * To support the use case of nested calls of OSEK/VDX like GetResource/ReleaseResource
 * functions, this function compares the stated value to the current task priority level.
 * If \a suspendUpToThisPriority is less than the current value then the current value is
 * not altered. The function still returns the current value and the calling code doesn't
 * need to take care: It can unconditionally end a critical section with
 * rtos_resumeAllTasksByPriority() stating the returned task priority level value. (The
 * resume function will have no effect in this case.) This makes the OSEK like functions
 * usable without deep inside or full transparency of the priority levels behind the scene;
 * just use the pairs of Get-/ResumeResource, be they nested or not.
 *   @remark
 * The expense in terms of CPU consumption of using this function is significant enough to
 * better avoid nested pairs of Get-/ResumeResource. As long as all resource and task
 * relationships are static, it'll be possible to replace nested pairs of function calls
 * by a single one with combined, maximum priority.
 *   @remark
 * The use of this function to implement critical sections is usually quite static. For any
 * protected entity (usually a data object or I/O device) the set of competing tasks
 * normally is a compile time known. The priority level to set for entry into the critical
 * section is the maximum of the priorities of all tasks in the set. The priority level to
 * restore on exit from the critical section is the priority of the calling task. All of
 * this static knowledge would typically be put into encapsulating macros that actually
 * invoke this function. (OSEK/VDX like environments would use this function pair to
 * implement the GetResource/ReleaseResource concept.)
 *   @remark
 * The raised priority is implicitly restored at the end of the task. It is not possible to
 * consider this function a mutex, which can be acquired in one task activation and which
 * can be releases in an arbitrary later task activation or from another task.
 *   @remark
 * This function must be called from the user task context only. Any attempt to use it from
 * OS code will lead to a crash.

 * exception.
 *   @param resumeDownToThisPriority
 * All tasks above this task priority level are resumed again. All tasks up to and
 * including this task priority remain locked.\n
 *   The intended use of this function is to restore the priority level of a task after use
 * of a resource, which had been protected by an earlier call of the counterpart function
 * rtos_suspendAllTasksByPriority(). Normally, \a resumeDownToThisPriority will be set
 * to the value returned by the other function (or by a constant since this value is a
 * compile-time known in most use cases).
 *   @remark
 * To support the use case of nested calls of OSEK/VDX like GetResource/ReleaseResource
 * functions, this function compares the stated prioity value to the current priority
 * level. If \a resumeDownToThisPriority is greater than the current value then the current
 * value is not altered.
 *   @remark
 * It is impossible to shape a critical section with the safety task of priority above
 * #RTOS_MAX_LOCKABLE_TASK_PRIORITY and the attempt will always mean a functional error in
 * the design of the application code. To support debugging, this error is caught in DEBUG
 * compilation: Then the function throws a #RTOS_ERR_PRC_SYS_CALL_BAD_ARG exception if \a
 * resumeDownToThisPriority is greater than #RTOS_MAX_LOCKABLE_TASK_PRIORITY. In PRODUCTION
 * compilation, we have the normal behavior of silently ignoring attempts to actually raise
 * the priority.
 *   @remark
 * Besides the likely unwanted impact on the scheduling, it doesn't harm if a user task
 * calls rtos_suspendAllTasksByPriority() to raise the priority but doesn't lower it
 * later using this function. The effect of rtos_suspendAllTasksByPriority() will end
 * with the termination of the task. If a critical section is required at the end of a task
 * function it may even be advantageous to not call rtos_resumeAllTasksByPriority() in
 * order to save the overhead of the involved system call.

 *   If the calling task belongs to the set of tasks associated with \a idEvent, then it'll
 * have no effect but an accounted activation loss; an event can re-triggered only after
 * all associated activations have been completed. There is no activation queuing. The
 * function returns \a false in this case.\n
 *   Note, the system respects the priorities of the activated tasks. If a task of priority
 * higher than the activating task is activated by the triggered event then the activating
 * task is immediately preempted to the advantage of the activated task. Otherwise the
 * activated task is chained and executed after the activating task.
 *   @return
 * There is no activation queuing. Consequently, triggering the event can fail if at least

 * event. The function returns \a false and the activation loss counter of the event is
 * incremented. (See rtos_getNoActivationLoss().) In this situation, the new trigger is
 * entirely lost, i.e. none of the associated tasks will be activated by the new trigger.
 *   @param idEvent

 * (See rtos_osCreateEvent().)
 *   @param taskParam
 * All associated tasks will receive this value, when they are called because of this
 * trigger.\n
 *   The value is ignored if the function returns \a false.
 *   @remark
 * The function is indented to start a non cyclic task by application software trigger but
 * can be applied to cyclic tasks, too. In which case the task function of the cyclic task
 * would be invoked once additionally. Note, that an event activation loss is not unlikely
 * in this case; the cyclic task may currently be busy.
 *   @remark
 * It may look like an inconsistent API design if all associated tasks receive the same
 * value \a taskParam from the triggering event. The service could easily offer an API,
 * which provides an individual value to each associated task. The only reason not to do
 * so is the additional overhead in combination with the very few imaginable use cases.
 * In most cases an explicitly triggered event will have just one associated task; events
 * with more than one task will mostly be regular timer tasks, which make rarely use of the
 * task parameter.
 *   @remark
 * If \a idEvent addresses a regular, time triggered event and if triggering succeeds, then
 * the regular tasks will receive the passed value from now on. (Instead of the initial
 * value specified at event creation time, see rtos_osCreateEvent().) Note, there's likely
 * no use case for this, it's just a side effect of the implementation. However, it should
 * not do any harm, because mostly regular tasks don't make use of the task parameter and
 * mostly this service is not permitted for such events. If it could be harmful, e.g. if a
 * timer event exceptionally makes use of the task parameter, then explicit triggering of
 * the event using this service needs to be inhibitted.
 *   @remark
