/**
 * Operating system initialization function: Grant permissions for using the service
 * rtos_suspendProcess to particular processes. By default, the use of that service is not
 * allowed.\n
 *   By principle, offering service rtos_suspendProcess makes all processes vulnerable,
 * which are allowed as target for the service. A failing, straying process can always hit
 * some ROM code executing the system call with arbitrary register contents, which can then
 * lead to immediate task abortion in and suspension of an otherwise correct process.\n
 *   This does not generally break the safety concept, the potentially harmed process can
 * for example be anyway supervised by another, non-suspendable supervisory process.
 * Consequently, we can offer the service at least on demand. A call of this function
 * enables the service for a particular pair of calling process and targeted process.
 *   @param pidOfCallingTask
 * The tasks belonging to process with PID \a pidOfCallingTask are granted permission to
 * suspend another process. The range is 1 .. #RTOS_NO_PROCESSES, which is double-checked by
 * assertion.
 *   @param targetPID
 * The process with PID \a targetPID is suspended. The range is 1 .. maxPIDInUse-1, which is
 * double-checked later.
 *   @remark
 * It would break the safety concept if we permitted the process with highest privileges to
 * become the target of the service. This is double-checked not here (when it is not yet
 * defined, which particular process that will be) but as part of the RTOS startup
 * procedure; a bad configuration can therefore lead to a later reported run-time error.
 *   @remark
 * This function must be called from the OS context only. It is intended for use in the
 * operating system initialization phase. It is not reentrant. The function needs to be
 * called prior to rtos_osInitKernel().

/**
 * Compute how many bytes of the stack area of a process are still unused. If the value is
 * requested after an application has been run a long while and has been forced to run
 * through all its conditional code paths, it may be used to optimize the static stack
 * allocation. The function is useful only for diagnosis purpose as there's no chance to
 * dynamically increase or decrease the stack area at runtime.\n
 *   The function may be called from a task, ISR and from the idle task.\n
 *   The algorithm is as follows: The unused part of the stack is initialized with a
 * specific pattern word. This routine counts the number of subsequent pattern words down
 * from the (logical) top of the stack area. The result is returned as number of bytes.\n
 *   The returned result must not be trusted too much: It could of course be that a pattern
 * word is found not because of the initialization but because it has been pushed onto the
 * stack - in which case the return value is too great (too optimistic). The probability
 * that this happens is significantly greater than zero. The chance that two pattern words
 * had been pushed is however much less and the probability of three, four, five such words
 * in sequence is negligible. Any stack size optimization based on this routine should
 * therefore subtract e.g. eight bytes from the returned reserve and diminish the stack
 * outermost by this modified value.\n
 *   Be careful with operating system stack size optimization based only on this routine.
 * The OS stack takes all interrupt stack frames. Even if the application ran a long time
 * there's a significant probability that there has not yet been the deepest possible
 * nesting of interrupts in the very instance that the code execution was busy in the
 * deepest nested sub-routine of any of the service routines, i.e. when having the largest
 * imaginable stack consumption for the OS stack. (Actually, the likelihood of not seeing
 * this is rather close to one than close to zero.) A good suggestion therefore is to add
 * the product of ISR stack frame size with the number of IRQ priority levels in use to the
 * measured OS stack use and reduce the allocated stack memory only on this basis.\n
 *   The IRQ stack frame is 96 Byte for normal IRQs and 200 Byte for those, which may start
 * a user task (SW IRQs and I/O IRQs with callback into user code).\n
 *   In the worst case, with 15 IRQ priority levels, this can sum up to 3 kByte. The stack
 * reserve of a "safe" application should be in this order of magnitude.
 *   @return
 * The number of still unused stack bytes of the given process. See function description
 * for details.
 *   @param idxCore
 * The implementation of a process has an individual stack on each core running the RTOS.
 * Select the core of interest. Each core is permitted to check the stacks of each (other)
 * core.
 *   @param PID
 * The process ID the query relates to. (Each process has its own stack.) ID 0 relates to
 * the OS/kernel stack.
 *   @remark
 * The computation is a linear search for the first non-pattern word and thus relatively
 * expensive. It's suggested to call it only in some specific diagnosis compilation or
 * occasionally from the idle task.
 *   @remark
 * This function can be called from both, the OS context and a user task.
