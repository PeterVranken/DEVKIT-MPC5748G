- floating point: emulation lib or only on Z4, makefile setting
- Library selection: either Z2 or Z4, Z4 if Z2 no float? TBC: What is
  said/done in linker script?
- Devices supported. Global sharing like PIT and DMA channels
  - Clocks: full speed, all peripherals clocked
  - SMPU (all open, one uncached chunk)
  - PBridge (TBC: All open?)
  - DMA, LINFlex for serial
  - Watchdogs off
  - Reset escalation: off
  - SIUL2 as far as ports are required
- Basic intercore communication support:
  - Cache-inhibited data area
  - Decorated store
  - Memory barrier
  - mutex, nestable mutex and intercore critical section
  - no effective synchronization because no kernel
  - TODO thread-safe queue
  - Cross-core interrupts (two lines of code!)
- Serial
  - Unclear status of context-safe use (how is the new-lib library compiled?)
  - Use sio_write or restrict printf to a single core
- Debugger scripts: Pros & cons
  - The scripts are not a substitute for the IDE, they are not generally
    better but they have advantages in certain situations and are a
    valuable add-on
  - Can handle reset escalation. Even if switched off: Regular (not
    escalated) reset made IDE fail to coennect to target for setting break
    points and stepping through the code (re-flash of healthy SW was
    however possible)
  - Can speed-up the flash procedure, can beintegrated into makefile after
    build
  - Easier access to MCU registers, since the Embedded Sys plugin in the
    IDE is not working at all. We need to use the console window in the
    IDE instaeda nd this is much less convenient than a GDB in a normal
    shell window (IDE has no  commmand completion and with respect to
    repetition and modification of previously submitted commands)
  - Struggles with switching between cores and restart of MCU after reset.
    Mostly the server needs to be restarted
