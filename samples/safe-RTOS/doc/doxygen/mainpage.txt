safe-RTOS - A simple RTOS with safety support for MPC5748G

This is not the manual! The purpose of this documentation is to be a kind
of API browser to support the implementation of the software, which is
going to integrate the RTOS. Get a quick overview on the user accessible
API functions of the RTOS and the applied <a href="annotated.html">data
types</a>. Use it as a reference book while working on your embedding
software.

Being on page <a href="globals_func.html">API functions</a>, advance to
character *r*: All public API functions start with `rtos_`.

Caution, Doxygen doesn't scan assembly files and parts of the required
information may be missing.

For everything else, please refer to the <a
href="https://github.com/PeterVranken/DEVKIT-MPC5748G/tree/master/samples/safe-RTOS/doc/manual/manual.pdf">safe-RTOS manual</a> and in general to the <a
href="https://github.com/PeterVranken/DEVKIT-MPC5748G/tree/master/samples/safe-RTOS/">safe-RTOS GitHub project</a>.
