safe-RTOS (VLE) - A simple RTOS with safety support for MPC5643L

This is not the manual. The purpose of this documentation is to be a kind
of API browser to support the implementation of the software, which is
going to integrate the RTOS. Get a quick overview on the user accessible API
functions of the RTOS and the applied data
types. Use it as a reference book while working on your embedding
software.

For everything else, please refer to the <a
