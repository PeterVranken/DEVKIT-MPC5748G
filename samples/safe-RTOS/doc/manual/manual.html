<h2 id="_introduction">4. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>safe-RTOS is a successor of the simple RTOS previously published in
GitHub. The scheduler implements rate monotonic scheduling, i.e. it
implements a strictly hierarchical preemption pattern, which is for
example called tasks of "Basic Conformance Class" in the OSEK/VDX-OS
standard and which&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as a matter of experience and despite of its
simplicity&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;suffices to drive the majority of industrial applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By means of compile-time configuration, the kernel can be instantiated on
any set of cores. Nonetheless, safe-RTOS is still not a multi-core RTOS.
The different kernel instantiations don&#8217;t have any awareness of one
another and there are no core-spawning scheduling strategies. However, a
number of core-to-core comunication basics is offered; we have a shared
memory concept, which considers the complexity introduced by the cache,
mutex objects, spin locks and an interrupt based core-to-core notification
mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To meet the demands of safety-critical software, the concept of processes
has been added to the kernel. Software partitions or applications of
different criticality levels can be implemented and run in different
processes without fearing harmful interferences between them. A process is
a set of tasks, which have their own resources and cannot touch the
resources of the tasks from another process. These "resources" are
basically memory (data objects) and CPU (computation time; here the
resource protection has its limits, see deadline monitoring for details).
The kernel offers the mechanisms to design I/O drivers in a way that I/O
channels or I/O data become protected resources, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Memory protection is implemented with the memory protection unit (MPU) of
the microcontroller. The MPU contains a number of memory area descriptors,
which associate a range of memory addresses (defined by start and end
address) with access rights. Mre precise, it are addresses, regardless
whether memory, I/O registers or nothing is found at these addresses. Any
load and store of the CPU is either permitted by at least one of the
descriptors and then executed or it is suppressed and leads to an
exception. The access rights can be granted for read and/or write, they
depend on the CPU&#8217;s current execution mode ("problem state", see below)
and they can be granted to either all or only a particular process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The configuration of the memory area descriptors in the MPU, i.e. the
assignment of memory areas and/or I/O address space to the processes, is
done statically, it is done once at system startup. This has several
implications:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simple and lean code architecture with zero overhead for memory
protection (no swapping of memory area descriptors)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No indeterministic timing due to hit-miss-interrupts and according
corrective actions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitation of number of processes due to the given, fixed number of
memory area descriptors in the MPU (four application processes plus one
kernel process in the default configuration)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple, barely changeable memory layout for kernel and processes (see
below for details)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of C code is tightly coupled with linker script. This is
a strong disadvantage if the kernel should be integrated into an
existing software development project, which will already have its own
linker script. The essential requirements and implementation elements
from both linker scripts need to be identified, coordinated and merged</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The protection of the other resource, CPU ownership, is mainly done by time
monitoring of the tasks. If a task doesn&#8217;t terminate timely then it causes
an exception. The kernel supports deadline monitoring; a task (may) have a
termination date and if it hasn&#8217;t terminated at that time then it is
aborted by exception. This concept ensures that a task either meets its
deadline (i.e. has produced its results timely) or the timing problem has
been recorded and is reported, typically to some supervisory task.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note, deadline monitoring always punishes the failing task, although it
is not necessarily the causing task. A task may fail to meet its deadline
because it has been overly blocked by other tasks of higher priority - if
these do not exceed their deadline then only the poor task of lower
priority is punished. This may be not fair but it is to the point as the
system design fails to meet the timing requirements for the punished task.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A second, simpler yet often advantageous mechanism is offered for time
protection. The situation is recorded and reported as an "activation loss"
error when an event is triggered but not all tasks associated with the
event have terminated yet after the preceding trigger of the event. For
the most typical use case of timer events and regular tasks this would
have the meaning of a task overrun.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The kernel offers the priority ceiling protocol (PCP) to the tasks for
implementing mutual exclusion. A minor modification of this common
technique is a measure to protect the scheduling of the CPU against abuse
or software faults. The PCP is limited to tasks of a certain, configurable
maximum priority. PCP cannot hinder application tasks to execute, which
have a higher priority and it is therefore possible to implement a trusted
supervisory task, which can detect forbidden and potentially unsafe
blocking states caused by failing or malicious functional tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The outlined protection mechanisms were useless if application code could
circumvent them - be it by intention or because of uncontrolled execution
of arbitrary code fragments after a failure in the task. A task could for
example try changing a memory area descriptor in the MPU prior to
accessing otherwise forbidden memory or it could try suspending all
interrupt processing to get exclusive ownership of the CPU.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this is hindered by the two "problem states" of the CPU. It knows
the user and the supervisor mode. The CPU starts up in supervisor mode. In
this mode all instructions are enabled. The startup code configures the
MPU and ensures that the register set of the MPU belongs to a memory area,
which is accessible only for supervisor mode. The kernel switches to user
mode when an application task is started. Instructions, which would change
back to supervisor mode are not available in user mode. The application
task code cannot change the MPU configuration in its problem state (MPU
hinders access in user mode) and it cannot enter the supervisor mode to do
it then.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More general, what has been outlined specifically for the MPU holds for
all the I/O registers and many of the special purpose registers (SPR) of
the CPU. All of these can be accessed in supervisor mode only.
Consequently, a user task cannot access or re-configure any I/O device or
protected SPR.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of the described mechanisms together allow the design of a "safe
software" on top of this RTOS. (You can find a definition of a safe
software in our context in <a href="#secSafetyConcept">Section 6</a>.)</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The proposed RTOS is little exciting with respect to its functionality.
The scheduler implements the functionality of what is called the "Basic
Conformance Class 1" (BCC1) of the OSEK/VDX-OS standard and of its BCC2 with
the exception of activation queuing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The scheduler offers an API to create events that can activate tasks. An
event is either a regular timer event, triggered by the RTOS system clock,
or a software triggered event. The latter can be triggered either from
user code (if it has sufficient privileges) or from ISRs belonging to the
operating system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RTOS offers a pre-configured set of four user processes. The
limitation to four is a hardware constraint and for sake of simplicity no
virtualizing by software has been shaped. The operating system forms a
fifth process. The operating system startup code will register the needed
tasks. The registration assigns them to one of the processes and
associates them with one of the created events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All scheduling is strictly priority controlled. The triggering of an event
makes all associated tasks ready to run. This is called task activation.
At any time, the scheduler decides by priority, which of the <em>ready</em> tasks
becomes the one and only <em>running</em> task. This may involve preemption of
tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The operating system startup code can install needed interrupt service
routines (ISR). This will mostly appear in the initialization of the added
I/O drivers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For mutual exclusion of tasks, if shared data is involved, a lock API is
offered that implements the priority ceiling protocol (PCP). It is secured
so that supervisory tasks cannot be accidentally or purposely blocked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two slightly differing mechanisms to suspend and resume
interrupts but they are not available to application code, only the
operating system may use them (mainly for I/O driver implementation).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of the RTOS is further supported by some diagnostic functions.
They offer stack usage information, information about caught exceptions
and averaged CPU load information. The diagnostics come along with an API
to halt the execution of a (failing) process. Permission to use this API
is granted only to what is considered the safety process or task.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scheduler_and_preemption">5.2. Scheduler and preemption</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RTOS implements only tasks of basic conformance class (BCC). A task is
a finite code sequence, which is entirely executed, when it comes to a
task activation. BCC means that a task will have to complete before any
other task of same or lower priority can execute. Preemption occurs only
when a task is activated, which has a priority higher than the currently
running task. The preempting task is started and needs to complete before
the preempted task can continue execution. The preemption pattern of tasks
is strictly hierarchical, similar to the execution of nested functions in
a C program, see figure <a href="#figSchemeOfPreemptions">Figure 1</a>.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>

<div class="content">
<img src="manual_resources/taskSwitchesBCC.jpg" alt="Hierarchical task scheduling" width="80%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Hierarchical task scheduling</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hierarchical preemption pattern of tasks enables stack re-usage.
Basically, all tasks could share a single stack. However, the process
concept requires a separate stack per process, be it kernel or
user process. Moreover, all cores have an independent instance of the
kernel. Hence, given the number of user processes on the three cores be
n1, n2 and n3 then we would have a total of 3+n1+n2+n3 stacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although BCC means a significant reduction of complexity and functionality
in comparison to a full featured real time kernel, the embedded practice
mostly doesn&#8217;t require more than this. The typical data flow paradigm of
an industrial embbeded application is to have event triggered tasks, which
serve the asynchronous I/O channels and strictly cyclic application tasks,
which process the data and implement the control strategies. The
communication between ISRs and tasks is done either by queues or by
overwriting (last recent value supersedes earlier ones), that depents.
It&#8217;s a simple model, which has the advantage of being well understood,
transparent and by nature free of dead locks. The latency times are higher
than for consequently designed event controlled systems but they are
predictable and have easy to determine upper bounds. Last but not least,
software design can determine the upper bounds by choosing appropriate
cycle times.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_events">5.3. Events</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A task activation always happens by means of an event. The event is an
RTOS object, which is created in the initialization code sequence. A set
of tasks can be associated with an event. We have the relation 1:n for
events to tasks. Any task is associated with exactly one event. An event
has a method to trigger it. When the event is triggered then all
associated tasks are triggered (and the scheduler will execute them in the
order of priority).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An event can be configured such that it is implicitly triggered by the
RTOS clock. This functionality is limited to an arbitrary time for the
first trigger and an infinite, regular sequence of further triggers.
Evidently, this aims at "normal", regular tasks. However, even these
events still have the method for explicit trigger by software so that more
complex activation patterns could be implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Triggering an event is a privileged operation. By configuration it is
decided, which process may use the method for which event. For the
majority of events, this will only be the kernel process but there are
reasonable use cases for user tasks triggering specific events, too, and&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as long as privileges are granted with care&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;without breaking the
safety concept.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The method to trigger an event can be used from ISRs and from tasks. The
former can be used to implement deferred interrupt handling.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_operating_system_clock">5.4. The operating system clock</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RTOS is clocked by a timer interrupt. The clock rate is a compile time
configuration item and can be adjusted in units of a Millisecond. Most
sample applications of safe-RTOS use a 1 ms or a 10 ms clock tick. This
configured clock tick is the resolution of controlling the period of
cyclic tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The clock is generated by one of the MCU&#8217;s PID devices. If safe-RTOS is
configured to run on different cores then each core uses its dedicated PID
timer. The configured timers are not available to the application. If the
application requires to use the other PID timers then the initialization
needs to be done with care: For the PIT devices, there are common
settings, which affect all PID timers. You need to align your
initialization code with the RTOS kernel initialization, see
<em>rtos_osInitKernel</em>().</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="secPrioTaskAndISR">5.5. Priority of tasks and interrupts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The priority scheme of tasks is disjunct with that of interrupts. The
priority range of interrupts is 1..15. The priority range of tasks is
1..UINT_MAX. Regardless of the chosen numbers, any interrupt has a
priority higher than any task. An application task cannot shape a critical
section with interrupts but an OS task can do. (Which is one of the many
reasons, why an OS, which is built on this RTOS, must not make OS tasks
available to untrusted application code.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Preemption takes place only by higher priority; once a task is running
it&#8217;ll not be preempted by any other of same or lower priority. If two or
more tasks of same priority become ready at the same time then they are
executed sequentially, i.e. one after another. This introduces a kind of
sub-ordinated priority, which determines the order of execution in this
situation. This sub-ordinated priority is defined at RTOS configuration
time; in the given situation, the tasks would be executed primarily in
order of creation of the events, they are associated with, and secondarily
in order of registration, if they are associated with one and the same
event; see <em>rtos_osCreateEvent</em>(), <em>rtos_osRegisterOSTask</em>() and
<em>rtos_osRegisterUserTask</em>() for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What does "become ready at the same time" mean? This can be as easy as two
cyclic tasks that become due at the same nominal operating system clock
tick. For event tasks, which are triggered from one or more ISRs it&#8217;s less
evident. One ISR can trigger several events or several nesting, preempting
ISRs can each trigger one or more events. Due to the generally higher
priority of interrupts in comparison to tasks, all of the tasks, which are
associated with any of the triggered events, become effectively due at the
(logically) same time and compete for the CPU immediately after return
from the last of the nested interrupts. In this situation, the
sub-ordinated priority counts for those of same priority.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_exception_handling">5.6. Exception handling</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RTOS catches all possible MCU exceptions. Normal, failure free
operation of OS and application tasks will not cause exceptions; the
RTOS makes barely use of exceptions as principle of operation - like it
would for example when using the MPU exception for reloading some memory
descriptors. Therefore, an exception always means reporting an error.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any exception handler will first check, which process the exception
causing task belongs to. The RTOS maintains process related error counters
and the according counter is incremented. The exception handler will then
abort the failing task, i.e. it does do basically the same as the RTOS API
<em>rtos_terminateTask</em>() does, which voluntarily ends a task. Code execution
does not return to the failing code location. If a regular, time triggered
task fails, then it&#8217;ll be triggered again at next due time, regardless of
the number of counted failures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is virtually all, the RTOS does. In particular, there&#8217;s no error
callback or code to investigate the cause of the problem and to maybe
repair it. Similarly, there&#8217;s no decision logic which would limit the
number of failures and to stop a process in case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, our concept is to have a supervisory task&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;either as an element
of the implemented operating system or in the application code&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;, which
uses the RTOS' APIs to observe the number of reported failures and to take
the decisions for halting bad processes, switching off, shutting down or
what else seems appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our working assumption is that the OS code is proven to have no faults, so
there&#8217;s no need to handle an exception in this code. (The assumption of
fault free code is often referred to as "trusted code".) However, nobody
is perfect and even kernel or an I/O driver may contain undiscovered
errors. There&#8217;s no way to handle an exception caused by the OS code. In
this case, the exception handler enters an infinite loop to effectively
halt the software execution. It&#8217;s considered a matter of appropriate
configuration of watchdogs and of appropriate hardware design to ensure
that this will keep the system, which the software is made for, in a safe
state.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_deadline_monitoring">5.7. Deadline monitoring</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>User tasks, regardless if triggered by events or run by services
<em>rtos_osRunTask</em>() or <em>rtos_runTask</em>(), can have a bounded timespan for
completion. The ultimate end time is called the deadline of the task and
the supervision is called deadline monitoring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The timespan is the world time, not an execution time budget. At the
instance of starting the task its end time is defined. To the supervision,
it doesn&#8217;t matter whether the task really executes or if other tasks of
higher priority get the CPU most of the time. It is considered a failure
of the task if it doesn&#8217;t terminate prior to its deadline. This causes an
exception, which is counted in the process. The deadline exception has an
own counter and so it can be distinguished from all other exceptions; this
is essential because it&#8217;ll mostly be necessary to judge differently on
this exception in comparison to others (see below).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way it works is simple and efficient. The RTOS has a simple BCC
kernel, that doesn&#8217;t allow a task to suspend voluntarily. It is ready from
triggering till termination. This leads to a strictly hierarchical
preemption scheme (see <a href="#figSchemeOfPreemptions">Figure 1</a>) and, as a consequence,
to a single, ordinary stack for the kernel process. Each started task is
represented by a stack frame on this stack. When starting the task, the
kernel creates the stack frame and stores the deadline as an element. If
the task is preempted then a new stack frame is put on the stack (for an
ISR or a task of higher priority). During the execution of the preempting
context the kernel doesn&#8217;t care, whether the deadline of the preempted
task is exceeded or not&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the task can&#8217;t do any harm, it&#8217;s not executing
and the kernel could anyway not remove it from somewhere in the middle of
the stack. Only on return from the preempting context, when normally all
registers of the preempted context would be restored from the stack, the
deadline condition is checked. This requires only a few instructions; it&#8217;s
an arithmetic comparison of the stored end time with the CPU&#8217;s time base
register. The decision is clear - either we complete the return to the
preempted context or we raise an exception, which kills it. The
implementation can be that easy because the check is done when and only
when we return to the stack frame of the preempted, deadline-monitored
task: Now the end time is easily accessible and killing the task in case
is simply doable, because it&#8217;s on top of the stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The deadline monitoring aims only at protecting a supervisor user task of
high priority against starvation. Without it, a notification callback from
an ISR could spin in an infinite (or very long lasting) loop and the
supervisory task would not be scheduled until it returns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deadline monitoring is not meant a mechanism to control some task timing
in a functional sense. Any application design, which considers regular or
even occasional intervention of the mechanism as normal, will be bad
design! Therefore, a supervisory task should not generally tolerate
deadline exceedance exceptions in the supervised processes. It may need to
tolerate very rare occurrences due to exceptional high system load
and an accordingly high jitter in the task timing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Understanding these aims of the mechanism it becomes clear, why its
weaknesses are not painful. The check is only done on return from a
preempting context to the monitored task. This limits the time resolution.
The RTOS itself has a 1 ms interrupt, so the only general guarantee is an
according time resolution. The idea to limit e.g. a notification callback
to 50 µs will not work. If you think 50 µs should be enough under all
circumstances then you should indeed specify this time span. But
regardless, the callback may run up to 1 ms before it is surely killed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can of course count on a better time resolution if you have an
interrupt of higher frequency but if it pays off to install such an
interrupt only for the particular purpose of increasing the time
resolution will depend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite of the enormous possible relative timing error we see in our
example it doesn&#8217;t matter much with respect to the safety supervisory
task. When it becomes due the next time this will surely be connected to
an RTOS timer tick and this tick would mean the killing event for the bad
callback. No blocking for the safety task.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The worst thing, which can happen to the safety supervisory task: Its n-th
activation may be preempted by an ISR which invokes a bad, non returning
callback. The callback is killed at latest at the next RTOS timer tick. If
this tick is the same one at which the safety task becomes due the (n+1)st
time then the task would suffer from an activation loss; its n-th
activation would be resumed rather than starting the (n+1)st. If this
endangers the safety concept then the effect can be avoided by configuring
the RTOS timer tick frequency higher than the activation frequency needed
for the safety supervisory task.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Less obvious is a priority issue. An ISR, which runs a potentially failing
callback, can have an interrupt priority higher than the RTOS timer and
any other regular interrupt. So that there&#8217;s no upper boundary for the
maximum execution time of the callback. This consideration leads to the
safety requirement for the aimed operating system that any ISRs, which
run at a priority higher than the RTOS timer interrupt must not make use
of the service <em>rtos_osRunTask</em>(). The requirement is easy to fulfill as
all affected code is in the trusted sphere and most of it are static
configuration decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By principle, a deadline exception (as any other, too) can leave the
system in an inconsistent (yet not instable) state. The task may have been
killed in the middle of a critical section, in the middle of whatever
transaction. This may make other tasks fail, too, and lead to more
exceptions in the worst case. An important requirement for the safety
process is (and actually not only because of this effect) that it must be
functional regardless of the consistency of the data owned by the
supervised processes.</p>

<h4 id="_deadline_monitoring_to_be_used_or_better_not">5.7.1. Deadline monitoring: To be used or better not?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The design of an operating system building on safe-RTOS can make the
consideration, whether or not deadline monitoring needs to be applied at
all. If some design rules are obyed then the observation of the event
activation loss counters from the safety supervisory task will be
sufficient in most cases (see service <em>rtos_getNoActivationLoss</em>()).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using deadline monitoring is absolutely unavoidable if ISRs make use of
callbacks into user processes (using service <em>rtos_osRunTask</em>()). However,
in many situations this construct can be replaced by deferred interrupt
handling, i.e. by triggering an OS task that takes over the work from the
ISR. The triggered task would have a priority below the safety task and if
it is blocked by a non-returning, bad callback into the user process then
the safety task would immediately see the activation losses for the event
triggered by the ISR and likely some other (timer) events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically, the latency times resulting from observation of activation
losses will be a bit higher than when applying deadline monitoring. This
may have an impact on the design decisions.</p>

<h3 id="_distribution_and_integration">5.8. Distribution and integration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RTOS itself is not a runnable piece of software. It requires some
application code. The RTOS is distributed as a set of source files with
makefile and linker scripts and a few sample applications. The makefile
can take the name of an arbitrary file folder as root folder of an
application. This is the way a particular sample application is chosen.
The specified folder is recursively scanned for C/C++ and assembler source
files, which are compiled together with the RTOS source files and the
compilation ends up with a flashable binary file, which contains the
entire runnable software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you consider using safe-RTOS for your purposes, then it&#8217;s likely that
you already have your own development environment in place. If you want to
integrate the RTOS into this environment then it&#8217;s unfortunately more
complicated then just copying our RTOS sources into your project and
compiling them there&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the RTOS implementation depends on several
definitions made and decisions taken in the linker scripts and these
needed to be adopted by your compilation process. Please, refer to

<h4 id="_single_image_versus_three_images">5.8.1. Single image versus three images</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The NXP code samples for the DEVKIT-MPC5748G produce three separate memory
images, one per core. Our makefile produces just one for all cores. There are
several implications:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Debugger configuration: Three instances are launched. In our project
configuration, only the first one will load the image. The other two will
just load the symbols</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In our project we have a single run of the linker; the NXP concept
requires the run of the linker for each core. Therefore, we don&#8217;t need
preallocation of memory space to cores as done in the NXP samples.
Linkage will fail only if the overall consumption of memory exceeds
the physical limits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code is generally shared between the cores. No need to link identical
function code repeatedly into the distinct images of the cores. The C
library code and our RTOS are found once in ROM and executed by all
cores</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have only one symbol and address space for code and data on all cores.
On source code level, core-to-core communication barely makes a
difference to task-to-task communication on one core: The code running
on different cores can simply use the same variable names to access
shared recourses and they will really address to the same object at the
same address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NXP approach requires a kind of manual linkage for core-to-core
communication. Shared definitions in the three linker scripts and/or
related #<em>define</em>'s in the source code are needed to ensure that the
basically independent compile-and-link runs all allocate shared data at
the same absolute address. This reduces the flexibility of interface
design and implementation and it is error prone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our approach has a single, big disadvantage: By principle, the three
cores share the SDA and SDA2 address areas. This limits the amount of
small data address space to a total of 64 kByte each, i.e. the small
data of all three cores together need to fit into the 64 kByte. The NXP
approach with independent runs of the linker provides the 64 kByte
separately to each of the cores.</p>

<h2 id="secSafetyConcept">6. The safety concept</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This sections aims at giving an overview on the safety concept.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A typical nowadays embedded project consists of a lot of code coming from
various sources. There may be an Open Source Ethernet stack, an Open
Source Web server plus self-made Web services, there may be an Open Source
driver software for a high resolution LCD, a framework for GUIs plus a
self-designed GUI, there will be the self-made system control software,
possibly a file system for data logging on an SD storage, the C
libraries are used, and so on. All in all many hundred thousand lines of
code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the system can reach a state, which is potentially harmful to people or
hardware, then it&#8217;ll typically need some supervisory software, too, which
has the only aim of avoiding such a state. Most typical, the supervisory
software can be kept very lean. Depending on what kind of system we talk,
it may e.g. be sufficient to read a temperature sensor, check the
temperature against a boundary and to control the coil of the main relay,
which powers the system. If the temperature exceeds a limit or if the
temperature reading is somehow implausible then the relay is switched off
and the entire system unpowered. That&#8217;s all. A few hundred lines of code
can already suffice for such a task.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the rest of the software is not safety relevant. A fault in this
majority of code may lead to wrong system behavior, customer
dissatisfaction, loss of money, frustration, etc. but will not endanger
the safety of the system or the people using it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we rate the safety goal higher than the rest then we have a significant
gain in terms of development effort if we can ensure that the few hundred
lines of supervisory code will surely work always well and even despite of
potential failures of the rest of the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using a safety-aware RTOS can be one means to ensure the "working always
well" of the supervisory code. The supervisory code is put into a process
of higher privileges and the hundred thousands of lines of other code are
placed into a separate process with lower privileges. By principle, the
code in one process can not harm or damage the resources of the other
process (data and access to CPU or computation time). Nor can a process of
low privileges get access to I/O deemed safety-critical. (Only) RTOS and
supervisory code need to be carefully reviewed, tested, validated to
guarantee the "working always well". Using a "normal" RTOS, where a fault
in any part of the code can easily crash the entire software runtime
system, the effort for reviews, tests and validation needed to be extended
to all of the many hundred thousand lines of code. The economic difference
and the much higher risk of not discovering a fault are evident.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These basic considerations result in a single top-level safety requirement
for our safe-RTOS:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the implementation of a task, which is meant the supervisory or
safety task, is itself free of faults then the RTOS shall guarantee that
this task is correctly and timely executed regardless of whatever
imaginable failures are made by any other processes, be it on the same
or another core.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This requirement serves at the same time as the definition of the term
"safe", when used in the context of this RTOS. safe-RTOS promises no more
than this requirement says. As a consequence, a software made with this
RTOS is not necessarily safe and even if it is then the system using that
software is still not necessarily safe. Here, we just deal with the tiny
contribution an operating system kernel can make to a safe system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All other technical safety requirements are derived from this one.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_io_driver_model">7. I/O driver model</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RTOS implements only the kernel of an operating system. It doesn&#8217;t do
I/O configuration and processing beyond what&#8217;s needed for the kernel
operation. The user of the RTOS will most likely develop a software layer
around the kernel, which configures and operates the MCU&#8217;s I/O devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation of servicing a particular I/O channel is usually
called an I/O driver and the union of kernel and all required or supported
I/O drivers can be considered the operating system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An I/O driver can&#8217;t simply be programmed just like that. It has to
interact with the kernel - a safety concept for the entire software would
otherwise be impossible. Usually, the I/O driver interfaces between
hardware and application task. Therefore it becomes a bridge between
supervisor and user mode. The programming of the MCU&#8217;s I/O registers and
servicing the I/O devices' interrupts requires supervisor mode but the
API for the application tasks to fetch or set the conveyed I/O data needs
to be executable in user mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_memory_mapped_io_driver">7.1. Memory mapped I/O driver</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simplest way to implement an I/O driver is the memory mapped driver.
All conveyed information is placed in memory, which can be accessed from
the application tasks and from the OS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The API is a set of getters and/or setters, which simply read from or
write to this memory. The I/O driver registers a function at the OS to
process the data. This function can either be a regular timer based OS
task or an interrupt service routine (ISR). This function is executed in
supervisor mode and can do both, access the API memory and the I/O
registers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such a driver has one major drawback. There&#8217;s no immediate data flow
between data source and application task. A typical example would be an
analog input driver, which regularly samples the voltage at the input pins,
e.g. once a Millisecond. The conversion-complete interrupt would read the
ADC result registers and place the samples into the API memory. The
application tasks can read that memory at any time. They surely get the
last recently acquired samples but don&#8217;t really know the age of the
samples - which can be anything between zero and one Millisecond in our
example. This behavior has a significant impact on worst execution time
(WET) considerations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A related issue can be the consistency of the data set. The ADC may
provide several input channels, which are sampled coincidentally. The
result-fetching ISR has a priority above those from the application tasks.
Therefore, the ISR can preempt the application task while it is busy with
reading all the channel results. As an effect, the application task will
see some samples from before and some from after the preemption. The set
of samples is inconsistent; the age of the samples differs by one cycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If consistency of a data set matters for an interrupt driven I/O driver
then it can either apply a double-buffering strategy or it delegate the
API update to an OS task of sufficiently high priority. Delegation means
the ISR just triggers the event the task is associated with. The task
reads the I/O registers and writes the results into the API buffers. This
design is often referred to as "deferred interrupt handling". The
difference is that the API now can implement critical section code&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;this
is possible between different tasks, between OS tasks and ISRs but not
between application tasks and ISRs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Memory mapped I/O drivers are the best choice whenever the sketched
drawbacks don&#8217;t matter&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and in particular for input channels: The
application task only reads the API memory and reading memory is not
restricted for any of the processes. The memory can be owned by the driver
implementation and the getters read the results without fearing an MPU
exception.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additional considerations are required for output channels. It&#8217;s still
quite easy if only one process is granted access to the API. Now, the API
memory is owned by this process. It can write to this memory through the
setters and the driver code can read and modify it (race conditions
disregarded here).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If however two or more processes want to use the I/O channel then a
remaining simple way of doing is putting the API memory into the shared
memory, which can be written by all the processes. Such an architecture
needs attention as this opens the door for race conditions between
processes and manipulation or violation of data that has been written by
one process by another process. Which can mean a violation of the safety
concept of the aimed software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative can be a driver architecture with two or more API memory
buffers, one for each process and owned by that process. Note, this
concept requires some arbitration if more than one process wants to
control an output channel in this way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Memory mapped drivers allow the implementation of privileged output
channels in the most simple way. For example, a safety critical actuator
must be available exclusively to the safety process. Just let the API
memory be owned by that process and any other process trying to access the
output will be punished by an MPU exception but not be able to operate the
actuator.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_callbacks">7.2. Callbacks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Particularly for input channels, the main disadvantage of memory mapped
drivers, the disrupted data flow, can be eliminated with an I/O driver
using callbacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two possibilities exist. Firstly, the driver may offer to serve a user
defined callback. The application task would specify a function to be
called from the I/O driver if some data becomes available. The I/O driver
will likely be implemented as an ISR, which is invoked by hardware, when
the I/O device acquired the data. Inside the ISR, the implementation will
make use of the RTOS API to run a user task, namely <em>rtos_osRunTask</em>(). The
task function is of course the agreed callback.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The callback is executed in the context of the aimed application process.
If it would fail (e.g. forbidden memory access causes an MPU exception)
then it would be aborted and control went immediately back to the the task
starting ISR.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A typical element of this architecture would be the use of deadline
monitoring. The callback is a sub-routine of the ISR and its execution
time would prolongate the execution time of the ISR - which is constrained
in typical scenarios. A deadline for the (unknown, untrusted) user
callback code will limit the possible damage by bad callback behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The callback is executed at same priority as the ISR, i.e. a priority
above all normal tasks and particularly above the safety task. This
involves a safety risk: Deadline monitoring is not generally available to
tasks with an interrupt priority greater or equal to the kernel priority
(a configurable compile-time constant) and running untrusted callback code
without an execution time constraint would break the safety concept of the
aimed software; an infinite loop would already suffice to hinder the
supervisory task from executing.
  <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second way to implement a callback is using a dedicated event. The
callback is implemented as a task, which is associated with the event. By
triggering the event, the ISR activates the task. Independently, the
scheduler of the RTOS decides when to make the task running. The task is
user code owned, belongs to the same, supervised process and can implement
the notification as suitable in this context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are significant differences between both solutions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using an event means less time uncertainty for the ISR implementation.
The event has a lower priority than the ISR, so the ISR is surely not
preempted and triggering the event will be done in no time. The ISR can
return soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the event means to have better control on priorities. The callback
has a priority, which can be balanced with the other tasks. The other
side of the coin: This can break the intended tight coupling in time,
which is normally expected from interruppt based I/O drivers</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please refer to the sample I/O driver

for additional details. This driver uses the first method to implement an
immediate notification of a user process when a button on the evaluation
board is pressed or released.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_system_call">7.3. The system call</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next way to design an I/O driver is the system call. The system call
is a function, which is executed in supervisor mode. In our RTOS, the
supervisor mode is not constrained in accessing I/O registers and memory
locations. Therefore, a system call can be applied to do any kind of I/O.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock caution">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-caution" title="Caution"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
The system call function is executed in supervisor mode and
doesn&#8217;t have exception handling or failure reporting and handling. By
principle, the implementation belongs into the sphere of proven, trusted
code. A user or application supplied function must never be accepted or
installed as a system call or be called as a sub-routine of a system call,
only proven driver code can serve as system call. Any exception from this
rule will potentially break the safety concept.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the perspective of the calling application code, a system call
behaves like an ordinary function call. It has a number of arguments and
it returns a result. Many operating system services can be modelled in
this way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The kernel offers three kinds of system call functions. They are called
conformance classes and the choice of the right class is a trade-off
between functionality and ease of implementation on the one hand and
overhead or execution time on the other hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_conformance_classes">7.3.1. Conformance classes</h4>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_basic_handler">Basic handler</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leanest and fastest system call is the basic handler:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The basic system call function must be implemented in assembler. The
RTOS doesn&#8217;t prepare the CPU context as required for a C compiler made
function</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handler is invoked with interrupt handling being suspended. It
is non-preemptable and must not resume interrupt processing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handler must neither use the stack and nor the SDA pointers r2 and
r13</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handler must comply with the usual EABI requirements for
volatile and non-volatile registers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The basic system call offers a maximum of flexibility and control; the
handler is not restricted to be just an ordinary synchronous function
call with return. For example, the "throw exception" system call, i.e.
<em>rtos_terminateTask</em>(), is implemented this way, it returns to the
operating system but not from the system call</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The programmer of a basic system call has the full responsibility for
every detail. The only things the RTOS code does are the switch to
supervisor mode and the table lookup operation to find the entry into the
handler. The implementation of the handler takes care for everything else.
For example, if it needs a stack then it is responsible for getting one&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which may be the kernel stack or any memory else, which is known to be
safe. If it wants to make use of the short addressing modes then it would
have to validate or repair the SDA pointers first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, as a rule of thumb: If your handler really intends to do these
kind of things then you are likely using the wrong handler conformance
class. Have a look at the others, which provide such kind of services to
you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The true intention of the basic handler is writing system calls, which
consist of a few machine instructions only, which are then executed
without the significant overhead of the other conformance classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples are simple I/O drivers: Getting or setting a digital port is a
matter of loading an address plus a load or store - all in all two or
three instructions. Here, the basic handler perfectly suits.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_simple_handler">Simple handler</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "simple handler" will mostly suit for low-computational operations. It
executes slower than a basic handler but can be implemented as a C
function:</p>

<p>Stack is available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handler is a synchronous function call, i.e. it will return a result

</li>
<li>
<p>The handler receives a variable number of function arguments. Note, only
register based function arguments are supported, which limits the
function argument data to seven 32 Bit values or accordingly less 64 Bit
values. No error is reported if a system call implementation would have
more arguments; undefined, bad system call behavior would result</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handler receives the ID of the calling process. The implementation
of a process based concept of privileges is easy and straightforward</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handler may throw an exception, typically in case of bad function
arguments. An error would be reported for the process and the calling
task would be aborted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SDA pointers are validated, short addressing modes can be used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C code can implement the handler and using C is recommended</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handler is invoked with interrupt handling being suspended. It is
non-preemptable and must not resume interrupt processing. No functions
must be called, neither in the handler function itself and nor in any of
its sub-functions, which can potentially enable the External Interrupt
processing. This includes but is not restricted to:</p>
<div class="ulist">

<h4 id="_maintaining_the_system_call_table">7.3.3. Maintaining the system call table</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>System call functions are statically defined. They are registered at
compilation time. They are all held in an RTOS owned table of such and
the calling code refers to a particular function by index. All the RTOS
has to do to avoid running untrusted code as a system call in supervisor
mode is to do a bounds check of the demanded index.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Organizing all system calls in one global, RTOS owned table requires some
attention drawn to the source code structure. System calls can be offered
by different independent I/O drivers and we want the implementation of
such a driver be self-contained. Instead of making all drivers dependent
on a shared file (which defines the table of system calls) we propose a
code and header file structure, which avoids unwanted code dependencies. A
driver implementation, which offers system calls, will expose them in an
additional, dedicated header file, from which the RTOS source code then
can compile the table. The file is named <em>mnm_driverName_defSysCalls.h</em>.
This involves mechanisms to safely avoid both, conflicting, doubly defined
table entries and undefined, empty table entries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each core has its own system call table. This has been decided to allow
having different implementations of one and the same service on different
cores. An I/O driver could e.g. be implemented to mainly run on the first
core. Here, the system call implementation will really service the I/O
device. On the other cores, the same system call would rather implement
some core-to-core communication to just get the data, which had already
been acquired on the first core.</p>

After successful compilation of module <em>rtos_systemCall.c</em> and if you
specify <code>SAVE_TMP=1</code> on the command line of <em>make</em> then you can find the
actual, complete system call table in file
<em>bin/(..)/obj/rtos_systemCall.i</em>. Open the file in a text editor and
search for <code>const rtos_systemCallDesc_t rtos_systemCallDescAry</code>. You will
have a match per core.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The table of system calls has a fixed, maximum number of entries. The
table size is a compile time constant, see macro <em>RTOS_NO_SYSTEM_CALLS</em> in
file <em>rtos_systemCall.h</em>. Note, more than one code location needs
maintenance if the constant is changed. Follow the hints given in the
source code comments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you design your own I/O drivers it&#8217;s good practice to reserve index
ranges for each driver, e.g. start the indexes of a driver at multiples of
five or ten. Extensions of the drivers become possible without index
clashes (which are properly reported during the build) and without the
need for reworking other drivers to sort them out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system call indexes don&#8217;t need to form a consecutive sequence of
numbers. Not using certain indexes does no more harm than wasting 8 Byte
of ROM for each unused entry. There&#8217;s no runtime penalty and,
particularly, no danger of breaking the safety concept due to undefined
entries.</p>

<p>For application functions it depends. Some may be safely called by both,
application and OS code. (These are mostly very simple memory reading

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The configuration of the RTOS is generally static, i.e. the sets of events

Consequently, there&#8217;s no need for a dynamic, intelligent error handling
strategy. The implemented strategy will simply be to start the application
software if and only if all RTOS configuration and initialization calls
return "no error".</p>

<p>OS tasks. They belong to the kernel process with PID=0. They are
executed in supervisor mode and are not protected by the exception
mechanism. They are intended for use inside the intended operating
system only. (It&#8217;ll be very difficult to implement a safe software if
application code would be run from such a task.) Typical use case are
regular update functions in I/O drivers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User tasks. "User" relates to the CPU&#8217;s problem state; these tasks are
executed in user mode. Such a task belongs to a user process with
PID=1..4. User tasks are run under protection and, consequently, you can
specify a time budget for these tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initialization tasks. Up to one such task can be specified per process
(including the kernel process). User process initialization tasks are
run under protection and, consequently, you can specify a time budget
for these tasks</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The need for the initialization tasks may not be evident. It may look
simpler to let the aimed operating system simply invoke some callback
defined in the application code for initialization. This would however
break the safety concept; application code could fail or take control of
the system. The registered initialization tasks will be executed in user
mode in the according process and can&#8217;t do any harm to the system

supervisory task that it will always execute so that it can safely

take the perspective of the user, who is interested in access to data

the "resource" objects in the macros hide the priorities a task must

<h3 id="_defining_data_objects">9.2. Defining data objects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The filters route the input sections to the process memory areas. So if we
want a particular data object to be owned by a particular process, e.g.
<em>P4</em>, then we need to make it reside in one of the filtered sections. The
compiler offers a type decoration for this purpose (see
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.4/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html#Variable-Attributes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GCC
manual</a>): A term like
<code>&#x5f;&#x5f;attribute__(&#8203;(section(".data.P4")))</code> would be
added to the variable definition, e.g.:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>static uint16_t myVariable __attribute__((section(".data.P4.myVariable"))) = 99;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two remarks: Firstly, the section name contains ".data.P4": This makes the
variable go into process <em>P4</em>'s memory area for normally addressed data.
Secondly, the chosen section name ends on the name of the variable. This
is optional and it has no impact on the code but it makes the variable
appear in the linker generated map file&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which is often useful to
double-check proper locating of data objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The type decoration makes a variable definition somewhat bulky,
particularly when using the section name with contained variable name.
Therefore the RTOS offers some convenience macros to hide it. Consider
typing:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>#include "typ_types.h"
static uint16_t DATA_P4(myVariable) = 99;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>instead of the previous example. Both are equivalent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar macros are defined for uninitialized data objects or to place a

If the declaration of such a data object doesn&#8217;t contain the section

raised.</p>

<p>Another typical reason for exceptions is the use of a static variable
inside a function, which is called by different processes. This will fail

of the shared memory area but this can easily break the safety concept.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The linker script routes all unspecified data objects into the memory
areas of process <em>P1</em>. This process has the lowest privileges and is
intended to host the functional application code, which normally is the
majority of code. If such application source code does already exist then
it can be used without modification with the RTOS. In particular, you
don&#8217;t need to "grep" for all data definitions in order to add the type
decoration.</p>

<p>If there is some legacy application source code then there will likely be
some legacy build scripts, too. The legacy build scripts can&#8217;t easily be
used with safe-RTOS; the tight interference between the RTOS' own linker
script and the source code (MPU configuration and ownership of data
objects) needs to be adopted by the legacy scripts. Which is not
impossible but it shall be difficult. The existing build scripts will have
their own requirements concerning partitioning the memory map and
conflicts with the RTOS' concept of having three solid RAM areas per
process can easily arise. Careful analysis and deep understanding of the
existing linker script will be required to see if a migration is possible.
No general recipe can be given.</p>

<h3 id="_the_c_library">9.6. The C library</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The C library places all its static data objects in the normal <em>data</em> and
<em>bss</em> sections. Its source code does of course not make use of our macros
and all static data objects are owned by process <em>P1</em>. Therefore, <em>P1</em>
is the only process, which can make safe use of the C library functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The memory, which is reserved to the heap functions, has been placed in
process <em>P1</em>, too. All memory, which is got from the C library&#8217;s <em>malloc</em>
functions, is implicitly owned by process <em>P1</em> and can&#8217;t be written from
other processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many, if not most functions from the library won&#8217;t make use of static data
and do not depend on heap memory. They could therefore be used from other
processes, too. Regardless, this is not recommended for these reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The C library is an imported, untrusted, potentially unsafe piece of
code, which should not be applied just like that from a safety process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compilation of the C library requires care if it is going to be used
in a multi-threading environment. We use the original, pre-compiled
binaries, which have not been compiled considering the particularities
of our multi-threading environment. This makes its concurrent use from
more than one thread potentially unsafe&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which may be tolerated for the
functional code in <em>P1</em> but surely not for higher privileged safety
processes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Summarizing, a reasonable safety requirement would be allowing the use of
the C library in process <em>P1</em> (as a matter of experience, we never faced a
problem with concurrent use) but not allowing its use in operating system
code or in a safety process.</p>

<p>The RTOS is a set of services, which permit the implementation of an
operating system that runs some application code. It is not a
self-contained, runnable piece of software. The build process requires the
specification of some sample application code, which is compiled and
linked with the RTOS code. Now, the build process yields a flashable and
runnable binary.</p>

<h3 id="_sample_application_benchmark">10.5. Sample application "benchmark"</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sample application simulates a true RTOS application with respect to
scheduling and task timing so that it can make a statement about the
overhead imposed by the kernel&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;at least in direct comparison of
different kernels. (The absolute result figures are rather meaningless.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application does do nothing but incrementing some task counters in
order to get an alive indication of the tasks. The rest of the task bodies
is busy waiting. The configured tasks and their individual busy wait times
are chosen as considered realistic for a true embedded application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A typical inter-task communication pattern has been simulated: Mutual
exclusion with a subset of other tasks is implemented at entry and on exit
from a task. This simulates a data flow based task interface: Input data
is copied from some shared area at the beginning of the task execution.
Then the task spends most of its execution time with computation of its
results and at the end it again uses a critical section with mutual
exclusion to copy its results to some other shared areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A relative high interrupt load has been configured, too. The interrupts
have different priorities and preempt each other. The application tasks
are frequently preempted by the interrupts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>None of the actual operations of a true application has been simulated,
just the timing. But due to the significant interrupt load and the
splitting of the busy times into phases of mutual exclusion with other
tasks and pure, autonomous computations the timing and activity of the
kernel should resemble a true application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application regularly reports the averaged total CPU load and the
portion, which is spent in the kernel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reported kernel CPU times have been computed as difference of the
overall CPU load and the sum of applied busy wait times. The reported
value therefore includes everything but busy waiting, e.g. the call of the
nearly empty ISRs, the call of the task functions and incrementing of the
alive counters. So it&#8217;s not only the time spent in actual kernel
functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reported value has no particular meaning on an absolute scale but it
can be useful to compare different revisions or variants of the RTOS, like
with/without safety support or HW versus SW scheduler. It may also be
useful to compare with other RTOSs, if they offer a similar API.</p>

<a href="#_footnoteref_2">2</a>. It would be a considerable design decision to implement the safety task in turn as a callback from a (regular timer) ISR of even higher priority to overcome this problem.

<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_3">
<a href="#_footnoteref_3">3</a>. It may look like an inconsistent API design if all associated tasks receive the same value <code>taskParam</code> from the triggering event. The service <em>rtos_triggerEvent</em>() could easily offer an API, which provides an individual value to each associated task. The only reason not to do so is the additional overhead in combination with the very few imaginable use cases. In most cases an explicitly triggered event will have just one associated task; events with more than one task will mostly be regular timer tasks, which make rarely use of the task parameter.
