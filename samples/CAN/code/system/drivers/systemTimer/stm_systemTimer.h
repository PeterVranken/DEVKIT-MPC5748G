/**
 * Read one of the three system timers. The function can be called at any time from any
 * context on any core. It must not be called before stm_initSystemTimers() has completed.
 *   @return
 * The timers are running at #STM_TIMER_0_CLK, #STM_TIMER_1_CLK and #STM_TIMER_2_CLK Hz The
 * unit of one step of the counter value is the reciprocal, i.e. 12.5 ns for timer 0. The
 * units are accessible as #STM_TIMER_0_PERIOD_IN_NS, #STM_TIMER_1_PERIOD_IN_NS and
 * #STM_TIMER_2_PERIOD_IN_NS.\n
 *   The timers wrap at 2^32-1. This limits measurable time spans to 2^32 * 12.5ns = 53.6s
 * for timer 0.
 *   @param idxTimer
 * The index of the timer in the range 0..2. Our configuration lets the timers count at
 * different speeds to support high resolution for short time measurements and low
 * resolution measurements of longer time spans.\n
 *   The maximum duration of time spans measurable with highest resolution is about 53s
 * (timer index 0).\n
 *   The longest measurable time span is 3.8h with lowest resolution (timer index 2).\n
 *   The medium timer (index 1) has a resolution of 200ns, which is best suited for
 * rescaling measured times into human readable representation.
 *   @remark
 * This function is available solely to OS tasks and ISRs. User code would cause a memory
 * protection exception. User mode code uses stm_getSytemTime() instead.
 *   @remark
 * This function is available to code running on any core, regardless whether safe-RTOS is
 * configured and running on that core or not.
