         The configuration of in- and output pins is documented in the Excel workbook
       MPC5775B_MPC5775E_System_IO_Definition.xlsx; which is embedded into the MCU
       reference manual PDF file. In Acrobat Reader, click View/Show/Hide/Navigation
       Panes/Attachments to find the Excel workbook.
         In the Excel workbook, on worksheet "IO Signal Table", each line refers to one of
       the possible functions of a port. The port is found in column A and most relevant
       are the settings "SIU_A PCR#" in column B, and "PCR PA" in column C. They designate
       the index of the PCR register to use and the source selection, which is a major
       field of this register.
         The port has a fixed, hardwired, however chip-housing dependent one-by-one
       relation with a pin. This relation is found in columns I and J and on tab "416
       PBGA".
         The source selection relates to the connection from an I/O device to the output
       buffer of the port.
         To connect an input of an I/O device with a port, a selection of one out of
       different offered input sources needs to be made besides the port configuration
       itself. Selecting the wanted input means configuring an input multiplexer register.
       There are nine such registers and they contain a varying number of multiplexers
       each. You need to know, which multiplexer register to use and which multiplxer
       inside the register and which value to configure for this multiplexer. All of this
       is found either in the description of the registers (RM, sections 8.2.66ff) or by
       name of the signal in the Excel workbook
       MPC5775B_MPC5775E_System_IO_Definition.xlsx, worksheet "Input Muxing". In the Excel
       worksheet look for the wanted device (column B, "Instance") and/or for the wanted
       signal (column H, "Source Signal"). Columns D, E and F provide the needed three
       pieces of information for the multiplxer configuration. */

/**
 * Application dependent initialization of CAN communication: The driver will react only on
 * CAN message, it has agreed on with the application SW. This API is intended for making
 * such an agreement. By calling this function, the application requests one particular
 * CAN mailbox in the hardware for a particular message, for either reception or
 * transmission.
 *   @return
 * Mailbox reservation can fail. Mainly, because the number of outermost processable
 * messages is limited. The total number of all messages is limited by hardware and the
 * driver has no implementation of virtualization; if the Rx FIFO is enabled then numbers
 * of Rx and Tx messages even have different, indivdual limits.\n
 *   The function returns \a cdr_errApi_noError in case of success. In all other cases it
 * has not effect.\n
 *   All possible errors are static configuration errors in the client code. There's no
 * need to have a dynamic error check at run-time. The appropriate way to handle the return
 * code of this function is an assertion in DEBUG compilation. If it proves once that the
 * function returns \a cdr_errApi_noError then there's no risk to ever see another return
 * code in PRODUCTION compilation.
 *   @param idxCanDevice
 * The administration of messages and mailboxes is made independently for all enabled CAN
 * devices. This parameter chooses the affected CAN device.\n
 *   See enumeration \a cdr_enumCanDevice_t (actually a zero based index) for the set of
 * possible devices.\n
 *   @param hMB
 * The driver has a fixed structure of mailboxes. (A structure, which is modifiable by
 * configuration only to little extend: FIFO on/off, size of FIFO filter table).
 * Consequently, all mailboxes have a fixed index and we use this index as a handle to
 * refer to a particular mailbox. Usually, a driver will deal out a handle. Our driver
 * doesn't do but lets the client code choose the appropriate handle. The reason is that
 * the mailboxes have differing properties, which are known to the client code. By letting
 * it chosse the handle, hence the mailbox, it can decide, which mailbox suits best.
 * Relevant differences between mailboxes are:\n
 *   - The first n mailboxes belong to the Rx FIFO. They can't by used for transmission. n
 * depends on the configuration of the FIFO. The remaining, normal mailboxes are available
 * to Rx or Tx\n
 *   - The normal mailboxes are organized in groups of 4, 16 or 32. Each of these groups
 * can have a different interrupts, depending on the driver configuration. Different
 * interrupts means different priority, processed on different cores and/or using
 * different notification callbacks.\n
 *   The range of hMB is 0..N, where N depends on the chosen configuration.\n
 *   Details on how n and N relate to the made configuration can be found below.\n
 *   An out of range handle or using a handle, which had already been used in an earlier
 * call of this function, is considered an error.\n
 *   Note, each CAN device has its own, individual space of handle values.
 *   @param isExtId
 * Standard and extended CAN IDs partly share the same space of numbers. Hence, we need the
 * additional Boolean information, which of the two the ID \a canId belongs to.
 *   @param canId
 * The standard or extended ID of the CAN message, which the mailbox reservation is made
 * for.
 *   @param isReceived
 * The Boolean information, whether the mailbox is prepared for reception (\a true) of
 * transmission (\a false).
 *   @param TxDLC
 * The number of bytes of a Tx message in the range 0..8.\n
 *   The value doesn't care for Rx messages and it doesn't even care for Tx messages if
 * the send API cdr_osSendMessageEx() is exclusively used. The simple send API
 * cdr_osSendMessage(), however, will send the messages with this TxDLC. The range is 0..8.
 *   @param doNotify
 * The Boolean choice whether or not the completion of the mailbox activity will trigger an
 * interrupt. If set to \a true then an Rx mailbox will raise an interrupt if the reception
 * buffer has just been filled with a message from the bus and an Tx mailbox will raise the
 * interrupt when it has entirely serialized a message on the bus. By callback invokation,
 * the interrupt handler notifies the client code about the event and provides it the
 * required information (e.g. message payload for Rx mailboxes).\n
 *   The choice of the notification callback is made in the driver configuration. All
 * mailboxes of one group share the same callback.\n
 *   It is considered an error if a notification is requested for a mailbox that belongs to
 * a group, which is no interrupt configured for.
 *   @remark
 * The number n of FIFO mailboxes is 8*(CTRL2_RFFN+1) if the FIFO is enabled
 * (isFIFOEnabled=true) and 0 otherwise. CTRL2_RFFN and isFIFOEnabled are compile-time
 * constants in the driver configuration. Handle values 0..(n-1) make a CAN message
 * received via FIFO.\n
 *   The number m of normal mailboxes is (noMailboxes-8-2*CTRL2_RFFN) if the FIFO is
 * enabled (isFIFOEnabled=true) and noMailboxes otherwise. noMailboxes, CTRL2_RFFN and
 * isFIFOEnabled are compile-time constants in the driver configuration. Handle values
 * n..(n+m-1) place a CAN message in a normal mailbox. The massage can be either Rx or
 * Tx.\n
 *   The total number N=n+m of processable CAN messages is noMailboxes+6*CTRL2_RFFN if the
 * FIFO is enabled (isFIFOEnabled=true) and noMailboxes otherwise. noMailboxes, CTRL2_RFFN
 * and isFIFOEnabled are compile-time constants in the driver configuration. This number is
 * available as cdr_maxNoCanIds(), too.
 *   @remark
 * The hardware provides plenty of mailboxes. Therefore, we decided not to make the
 * acceptance mask available to the client code. This mask would allow sharing a mailbox
 * between a set of CAN messages with similar CAN IDs. This mechanism has some deficiencies
 * in terms of ease of use and wouldn't be available to all mailboxes in a homogenous way.

           so the interrupt is already negated on entry into this function.
             Consequently, if we unconditionally negate the flag here, then we either do,
           what we need to do (if no Tx notification is configured) or what is useless but

/**
 * Read an Rx message from the mailbox. This is the polling based receive API of the CAN
 * driver. The contents of the mailbox are returned if a message had been received since
 * the preceding invocation of this function for the same mailbox.\n
 *   Regularly polling a mailbox is an alternative to notification of reception by
 * interrupt and callback. For a given mailbox, either technologies can't be combined. This
 * is double-checked and the function returns \a cdr_errApi_pollingOfMailboxWithIRQ in case.
 *   @return
 * If the function returns either \a cdr_errApi_noError or \a cdr_errApi_warningRxOverflow
 * then a new message had been arrived and the mailbox contents are returned to the
 * caller.\n
 *   \a cdr_errApi_noError should be the normal case, while \a cdr_errApi_warningRxOverflow
 * indicates that the call of the function came too late to read all incoming messages; at
 * least one preceeding message had been lost and overwritten by it successor.\n
 *   If no new data is available (no message had been received since the previous call of
 * this function for the same mailbox or the mailbox is instantly blocked by a
 * coincidental reception event) then the function returns \a cdr_errApi_rxMailboxEmpty.
 *   \a cdr_errApi_rxMailboxEmpty is returned, too, if one tries to read from a mailbox,
 * which had been configured for Tx.\n
 *   None of the other (pointer based) function results is set if the return code is other
 * than \a cdr_errApi_noError or \a cdr_errApi_warningRxOverflow.
 *   @param idxCanDevice
 * The administration of messages and mailboxes is made independently for all enabled CAN
 * devices. This parameter chooses the affected CAN device.\n
 *   See enumeration \a cdr_enumCanDevice_t (actually a zero based index) for the set of
 * possible devices. An out of range situation is reported by return value \a
 * cdr_errApi_handleOutOfRange.\n
 *   \a cdr_errApi_pollingOfMailboxWithIRQ is returned if the read method is applied to a
 * mailbox, which had been configured for Tx.\n
 *   None of the other (pointer based) function results is set in case of an error.
 *   @param hMB
 * The message to send is identified by the handle of the mailbox it is associated with. A
 * message can be received only if it had been associated with a mailbox in the hardware, i.e.
 * a successful call of cdr_osMakeMailboxReservation() is prerequisite of using this
 * function. The handle to use here is the same as used when having done the related call
 * of cdr_osMakeMailboxReservation().\n
 *   Only normal mailboxe can be used for polling. The handle of a mailbox in the FIFO is
 * invalid. (I.e. handle value less than cdr_getNoFIFOFilterEntries().)\n
 *   An out of range situation is is reported by return value \a
 * cdr_errApi_handleOutOfRange. None of the other (pointer based) function results is
 * set in this case.
 *   @param pDLC
 * At entry into this function, * \a pDLC is the size in Byte of the output buffer \a
 * payload. No more than this number of payload bytes will be returned.\n
 *   After return, the caller will find the received number of bytes in * \a pDLC.
 *   @param payload
 * The received \a DLC message content bytes are placed into this buffer.
 *   @param pTimeStamp
 * The time of reception of the message is recorded by hardware and the value is returned
 * as * \a pTimeStamp. The absolute value has not meaning, time-base is a free running 16
 * Bit counter. The frequency of the timer is the CAN bit rate; having a bus with 500 kBd
 * the unit of the timer would be 2s. The timer wraps around at 2^16-1.\n
 *   \a pTimeStamp can be NULL if the called doesn't want to make use of the time stamp.
