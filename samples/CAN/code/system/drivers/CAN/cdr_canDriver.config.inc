/**

 * Application dependent configuration of CAN I/O driver.
 *   @remark
 * This file actually is a C source file. It is not named as such as it should not be
 * compiled as an independent compilation unit. Instead, we include it from the driver
 * implementation file. Reason is the possibility, to have a default configuration here in
 * the driver implementation folder but to overload it with the true, application dependent
 * file by setting the compiler include search path accordingly or by renaming the file
 * here or -- less convenient but safer -- by renaming it here.
 *   @todo
 * We should investigate if a weak implementation wouldn't be the better way to implement
 * the overloading.

/** @todo Revise this text block and integrate it
Concept: We have a configuration file with the settings as initialized const struct. The
designated initializer expressions keep this well-maintainable. The driver implementation
offeres a default or standard configuration. This is part of the driver implementation. Any
application will copy this to a local folder, where it can be modified to match the
application needs. Inclusion of the right file can be an issue. It can be handled via the
order of entries in the compiler include search path (risk of hard to find mistakes) or the
default configuration file in the driver implementation file is renamed.

Rational is the re-use ofthe same source code in different scenarios. Mainly, this
addresses having several test applications, which can all be build in the same environment
and which may all use different driver configurations.

The configuration starts with a set of principal macros, which enable or disable each of
the physical available CAN devices. These macros don't enable runtime activities but they
control the compilation of code and data elements from the driver. Code elements like ISRs,
configuration and data objects will only be compiled (and consume resources) if the related
CAN device is enabled.

At runtime, the reference to a device is made by zero based index. The mapping to a CAN
device is possible by a const lookup table, which is generated by preprocessor switches.
The indexes can be made available via an accordingly generated enumeration.

The index based addressing to the device makes associated configuration and run-time data
objects accessible in O(1).

Interrupt services don't need the lookup table, they know implicitly to which device (and
thus configuration and data object) they belong.

User services, like polling a mailbox, will require the index and the loop-up.

Interrupts: On any core but in groups. Polling for simplicity core-wise in same groups: No
limitation for any realistic use-case.

/** The Rx polling API for user code requires some attention drawn to memory allocation.
    The API implementation wants to allocate memory for all Rx mailboxes, which are enabled
    for polling. (It's an assumption that most applications will process most messages on
    event base and that the number of polled messages is rather little.)\n
      The usual paradigm for a data fetching function is taking the address of some caller
    provided memory as argument and to place the result data via this pointer. If our user
    task API would follow this concept then it had to validate the pointer before use in
    order to avoid a memory protection issue from within operating system code.
    Unfortunately, pointer validation is an expensive operation and should be avoided for
    frequently called functions (see rtos_checkUserCodeWritePtr()).\n
      The pointer validation can be avoided by holding memory buffers for the API in the
    operating system data segment. It is readable by the requesting user process and
    in-corruptible. Static allocation is desired for performance reasons and to avoid
    generally undesired dynamic memory allocation.\n
      The static allocation discards reentrance of the related API function - which is not
    an issue as the function is by principle anyway not reentrant for one and the same
    message/mailbox.\n
      The only remaining complexity is the data declaration. Although the required size is
    a compile-time constant, it can't be figured out by a constant expression. Therefore,
    you need to (redundantly) specify the number of polling-enabled mailboxes in this
    define. Redundantly, as the same number is implicit to the privileges configuration of
    the mailboxes. The way out is a run-time check in the startup code of the driver, which
    proves the value specified here with respect to the configuration of the mailboxes.\n
      Note, the number specified here is the total number for all of the enabled CAN
    devices. */

            device between FIFO (plus CAN ID filter table) and normal mailboxes.\n
              CTRL2[RFFN] is the amount of RAM, which is occupied by the FIFO. It means
            that we have an Rx FIFO with up to 8*(RFFN+1) explicitly configurable Rx CAN
            IDs and another 90-2*(RFFN+1) mailboxes for either Rx or Tx messages. So we can
            process a maximum of N_max=90+6*(RFFN+1) different CAN messages, whereof at
            minimum N_rx_min=8*(RFFN+1) and at maximum N_tx_max=90-2*(RFFN+1) Tx messages.
            See RM 43.4.14, p.1740, for additional information. Examples:\n
              RFFN= 0, N_max= 96, N_rx_min=  8, N_tx_max=88 (widely useless, no MB extension)\n
              RFFN= 3, N_max=114, N_rx_min= 32, N_tx_max=82\n

              RFFN=15, N_max=186, N_rx_min=128, N_tx_max=58\n
              Another important aspect is polling. N_tx_max is the number of normal
            mailboxes, which can be used for either Rx or Tx. If they are used for Rx then
            the SW can use polling to receive the messages. The N_rx_min Rx messages can be
            received by interrupt only.\n
              Note, all mentioned maximum numbers are yielded only with a maximum number of

            preempting ISRs -- serving a mailbox can be preempted by serving another
            mailbox of higher priority. Therefore we allow to configure individually for
            each interrupt, which core is is served on and at which priority.\n
              If message Rx and Tx events produce an interrupt then the information is
