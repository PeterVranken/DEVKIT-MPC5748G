= Overview

This folder contains the implementation of a driver for interrupt based
core-to-core notifications. The hardware (INTC) based service to generate
interrupts an a core of choice is wrapped into a driver, that offers a
notification service as a further core-to-core communication channel.

The concept is simple. A core has an API to assert a SW settable
interrupt. The interrupt is configured to be handled by another core. This
other core will preempt the running task and it executes the ISR, which is
part of this driver too. The ISR can be configured for two basic actions:

* It may trigger an RTOS event (on the notified core)
* It may run a handler on the notified core

In particular the first action is beneficial: A task of sufficiently high
priority will execute the operation, which is deemed suitable for the kind
of notification.

However, the second action, effectively an ISR on the notified core, has
its own charme: The notifier receives a receipt when it is done. Memory
mapped data flow without additional synchronization measures and still
without race conditions can be easily implemented.

TODOC:

* Notification parameter
* Notification and activation losses
 
== Relationsship with kernel of safe-RTOS

The service is not considered an element of the kernel itself. safe-RTOS
implements a simple BCC scheduling, which doesn't support voluntary
suspension of threads. A beneficial integration of the service with the
kernel is therefore not possible. It would e.g. be possible to let the
notifier wait until the notified acknowledges -- but not without busy wait
and the busy wait -- if considered appropriate -- can be implemented as
easy in the application code using the API of this driver.

Consequently, the implementation of this driver could be used even without
the RTOS, e.g. on a core with bare-metal application code. Only the
notification by triggering an RTOS event must of course not be configured
in that case.

== Differing configuration concept

This driver uses a different configuration concept than the others. The
RTOS itself and most of our simple drivers so far use a run-time API for
configuration. This is transparent, elegant and user-friendly but means
putting some constant data into expensive RAM. In this driver, we use a C
implementation file with initialzed constant data objects for
configuration. Each application needs to have its individual
implementation file.
