/** Helper for definition of simple constant data objects.\n
      CAUTION: This section defining macro needs to be applied to all data objects, which
    are declared "static const" (no matter whether compilation unit or function scope).
    The default behavior of the compiler is to place such objects (except they are too
    large) in the SDA2 section in RAM. In RAM, the default placing is the area of process
    P1. Without explicit placing, this would mean that they go into some RAM, which process
    P1 has write access to. Any constant object, owned by a process other than P1, which
    would be default-located by the compiler in P1 RAM is vulnerable and will potentially
    break the safety concept.
      @remark safe-RTOS doesn't have an access control concept for constant data objects;
    they are generally readable by all processes. Therefore we don't offer specific macros
    for OS or user processes.
      @remark See #BSS_OS for further details. */
