moduleDescription() ::= <<
 * This header file contains a number of compile time checks of static elements of the
 * network database, which need to be fulfilled for successful compilation and execution of
 * the generated code.\n
 *   The file is included by the generated file <file.canApi_c> after setting a number of
 * #define's that are related to frames and signals. These defines are checked for valid
 * values. The checks are completed by some tests of the attributes, which the code
 * generation depends on. It's highly probable that these tests will emit a compile time
 * error if the code generation is done with an arbitrary other network file.
 *   @remark
 * All checks relate to static properties of the network database. If these tests can be
 * done by code generation template expressions (mainly the test of Boolean object
 * properties and test of existence of objects) then this way is preferred. A failing test
 * will generate an error directive, a successful test will not emit anything.\n
 *   Code generation templates are limited and cumbersome in doing numeric comparisons. If
 * those are required than the code generation process tends to generate according C
 * preprocessor conditions with #error directives inside.\n
 *   Since the former kind of tests is frequently used you will not see anything in this
 * file about most of the tests! Error code will show up only if the error has been
 * detected in the network file.
