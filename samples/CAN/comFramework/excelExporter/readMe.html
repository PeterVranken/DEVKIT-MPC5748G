<h1 data-number="1" id="excelexporter---rendering-excel-spreadsheets-as-text"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> excelExporter - Rendering Excel Spreadsheets as Text</h1>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This archive contains the binary distribution of excelExporter, an application that can translate the information found in one or more Excel workbooks into manifold textual representations. excelExporter is a general purpose text rendering application for Excel spreadsheets.</p>
<p>excelExporter is the auxiliary code generator from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/comframe/wiki/Home/">comFramework</a> project. However, the use of excelExporter is in no way restricted to the context of CAN interface generation in embedded, automotive software development. Because of its generality we decided to publish it as independent SourceForge project. This relates to the binaries and the documentation. The source code and the build scripts remain part of project comFramework; some of the links down here will thus point to that other project.</p>
<p>The principal aim of the tool is supporting automation tasks in software development environments. In the context of the comFramework project this targets the handling of data dictionaries and interfaces but excelExporter is by design independent from this intended purpose and will be useful for various other automation tasks.</p>
<p>You can render the information in the Excel input for example as:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML or LaTeX for reporting and documentation</li>
<li>Various XML formats for interfacing with other applications</li>
<li>C/C++ or any other textual programming languages</li>
</ul>
<p>In- and output description are decoupled in the parametrization of the tool. First you will specify a set of Excel input files. All of these are parsed and merged to one large data structure, ofter referred to as <em>data model</em>. Input files of same or of different format are supported. (“Format” refers to the structure of the Excel files with respect to contained sheets and columns.)</p>
<p>Secondary, you will define a list of output files. The specification of each output file is associated with the specification of a StringTemplate V4 template file. The template controls the output generation and this is how the same information is rendered once as HTML code and once as - for example - C program fragment.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="documentation"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Documentation</h2>
<h3 data-number="1.2.1" id="command-line-interface-of-excelexporter"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Command line interface of excelExporter</h3>
<p>The usage of the tool is explained in the application’s command line usage text: Begin with running excelExporter with command line option –help.</p>
<p>The command line interface of the application has the following concept:</p>
<p>The arguments form groups. A group of successive arguments can specify an input file, another group can specify another input file or an output file and so on. The beginning of a group of arguments is recognized by a specific argument, the principal argument of the group. The usage text typically says “this argument opens the context of …”. Naturally, the same command line switches can be repeatedly used, once in each group of same kind.</p>
<p>Such a group of command line arguments or a “context” actually is the representation of an object in the parameter tree of the application. This is the model behind the parameter tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root elements are either Excel input file specifications, specifications of generated output files or worksheet templates</li>
<li>The input file specification contains the Excel file name and it has any number of worksheet selection objects as children
<ul>
<li>A worksheet selection specifies one or more worksheets for parsing. All sheets or any sub-set of sheets of a workbook can be parsed. Selection can be made by name or by index</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An output file specification contains the file name and information about the StringTemplate V4 template to be applied</li>
<li>A worksheet template is a set of rules how to interpret one or more worksheets. It can be applied to a particular worksheet or to several of those, from either one or from several input files. It describes how the data of a worksheet is organized in terms of groups and sub-groups. It has any number of column attributes objects as children
<ul>
<li>A column attributes object specifies properties of a column, like name and sort order</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the command line arguments from a group or context there are “traditional” command line arguments, which relate to the run of the application as a whole, like logging and verbosity settings. The application usage text says they belong to the global context.</p>
<p>Please note, different to the common GNU command line interface this application demands a blank between the switch and its value. For example -oMyOutputFile.c would be rejected, whereas -o MyOutputFile.c would be the correct specification of a generated output file.</p>
<p>The application’s command line arguments relate to the definition of in- and output files and how to parse the input. This should be understood after reading the application usage text. To successfully use the application one still needs to understand the internal representation of the read input data (i.e. the data model) and the way it is rendered in the output files. The next sections explain the available, related documentation.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.2" id="the-data-model"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> The data model</h3>
<p>The internal representation of the parsed input information is explained in detail in Wiki page <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/excelexporter/wiki/The%20Data%20Model/">excelExporter’s Data Model</a> and it is documented as a <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/excelExporter/trunk/doc/dataModel/index.html?overview-summary.html">Javadoc of the complete data structure</a>.</p>
<p>In the Javadoc you find the documentation of all public elements of the data structure that are accessible from the StringTemplate V4 templates. The data structure is deeply nested, and actually, it are even two data structures, which are passed to the rendering process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parsed information forms an object of class <em>Cluster</em></li>
<li>The information about output files plus some environmental information is put into an object of class <em>Info</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You will study the Javadoc pages to see, which pieces of information to be used from within a template.</p>
<p>Please note, the Javadoc describes the different elements (classes) of the data model. Their nesting is not fully transparent from the Javadoc since recursive structures are involved. The actual structure of the data model will depend on (and reflect) the structure the input data is organized in. Only in the most simple case it’s a linear list of so called <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/excelExporter/trunk/doc/dataModel/excelExporter/excelParser/dataModel/RowObject.html">RowObjects</a>, which represent a single row from the Excel input file and which consist of so called <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/excelExporter/trunk/doc/dataModel/excelExporter/excelParser/dataModel/CellObject.html">CellObjects</a>. In all other cases the actual data structure depends on your input data, on the format of your Excel file and on your application configuration (which all needs to be consistent with one another).</p>
<p>The explanation of the data model and how its structure depends on Excel input and application configuration is given in the Wiki page mentioned before.</p>
<p>Another source of knowledge about the data model and how to access its elements is the investigation of the sample templates: <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/excelExporter/trunk/samples/">excelExporter/samples/…/*.stg</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.3" id="the-stringtemplate-v4-templates"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> The StringTemplate V4 templates</h3>
<p>The technique of rendering the information held in a <em>Cluster</em> and an <em>Info</em> object is well documented. The two objects are passed to the StringTemplate V4 template engine and this engine is fully documented. Please refer to <a href="http://www.stringtemplate.org/" class="uri">http://www.stringtemplate.org/</a> or find a printable version of the documentation as <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/excelExporter/trunk/doc/ST4-270115-0836-52.pdf" class="uri">https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/excelExporter/trunk/doc/ST4-270115-0836-52.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Please note, as a matter of experience, you will have to read the StringTemplate V4 documentation entirely before you can start to successfully develop your first useful template. StringTemplate V4 is powerful and convenient but not self-explaining.</p>
<p>Studying the samples <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/excelExporter/trunk/samples/">excelExporter/samples/…/*.stg</a> is another important source of information.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.4" id="the-wiki-pages"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> The Wiki pages</h3>
<p>An additional source of documentation are the Wiki pages of the project, please refer to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/excelexporter/wiki/browse_pages/" class="uri">https://sourceforge.net/p/excelexporter/wiki/browse_pages/</a>. The Wiki pages shade a light at some most relevant, selected issues; a comprehensive, self-contained (printable) manual is not planned. As of today, March 2021, we have the following discussions in the Wiki pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/excelexporter/wiki/The%20Data%20Model/">excelExporter’s Data Model</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/excelexporter/wiki/Grouping%20and%20sorting/">Grouping and sorting</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="installation"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Installation</h2>
<p>excelExporter is a Java 8 application. The installation is as simple as unpacking an archive and optionally setting an environment variable. It is described in detail in the file <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/excelExporter/trunk/doc/installation.txt">installation.txt</a>.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.4" id="whats-new"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> What’s new</h2>
<h3 data-number="1.4.1" id="release-1.0.5"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Release 1.0.5</h3>
<p>Integration of latest release of StringTemplate V4, which is 4.3.3.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.2" id="release-1.0.4"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Release 1.0.4</h3>
<p>Migration of source code to Java Open JDK 18.0.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.3" id="release-1.0.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.3</span> Release 1.0.3</h3>
<p>Text output, which contains non ASCII characters is now saved to file as UTF-8. (Used to be a non specified, default code page.)</p>
<p>Master sample “renderTable” re-designed. This actually is a small convenience application, which strongly simplifies the use of excelExporter for the most common use cases.</p>
<p>Fix: We found an Excel workbook, which let to still unexpected runtime errors of POI when evaluating the cell contents. These Java RuntimeExceptions had made the application immediately abort rather then reporting the problem. Now, the evaluation of affected cells is skipped with warning and no reasonable cell contents are accessible from the templates.</p>
<p>excelExporter has been migrated to the recent release of StringTemplate V4, which is 4.3.1. The only noticeable difference should be a fix of the white space handling in StringTemplate. It used to be very difficult to precisely control the generation of blank lines in the output. With this fix, the newline characters found in the templates are accurately conveyed into the generated output.</p>
<p>Caution, this will likely mean that this version of the code generator will produce different output when using the same, existing templates. The differences are however restricted to blank lines and should not matter in C code generation environments.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.4" id="release-1.0"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.4</span> Release 1.0</h3>
<p>After more than a year of hassle-free productive use of the tool we decided to make it a release and change the major field of the revision designation to one - even if there’s only little new functionality.</p>
<p>New sample renderTable: This folder contains pre-configured files for the most common use case of excelExporter. Copy these files to have a fully operational starting point for your excelExporter application - out of the box and without struggling with the complex and cumbersome command line of the tool.</p>
<p>Error handling improved. Internal errors of StringTemplate V4 during rendering are now streamlined with the application logging. Before, they were printed in the log (together with the bulky but in the given context meaningless Java stack frame) but were not recognized or counted by the application.</p>
<p>Minor improvements of documentation.</p>
<p>Fix: The field “isBlank” of a CellObject in the data model was not operational. Blank cells are not put into the data model at all; so any access to this field would evaluate to either false (for normal, non blank cells) or null (for blank cells). Now the data model offers the logically inverse as isNotBlank: This evaluates to true for normal, non blank cells or null (interpreted as false) for blank cells. This change is the only reason for the increase of the version number of the data model.</p>
<p>There should be no functional change for existing templates, which make use of the no longer existing field CellObject.isBlank: The behavior should be as wrong as it used to be. However, using the new field CellObject.isNotBlank, they can now be repaired.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.5" id="release-0.18"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.5</span> Release 0.18</h3>
<p>New cell type “date” introduced for spreadsheet cell objects. Time and date designations read from an Excel spreadsheet can now be rendered with the StringTemplate V4 DateRenderer and using format strings, which are similar to the Java class SimpleDateFormat.</p>
<p>A new sample has been added, timeAndDate, which demonstrates the new capabilities.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.6" id="release-0.17"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.6</span> Release 0.17</h3>
<p>Documentation extended and many corrections made on documentation.</p>
<p>The row object container got the new field prop to support the common use case of groups with a single row object.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.7" id="release-0.16"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.7</span> Release 0.16</h3>
<p>The initial release. Full functionality of the application but preliminary state of samples and documentation.</p>
