This is one of the very few publically available CAN database files, which
can be presented here for testing and demonstration.

CAN_RT_repaired.dbc: The original network database contains some errors.
An invalid CAN ID is used and several signals occupy bits, which are not
in the frame. This has been corrected in file CAN_RT_repaired.dbc.

CAN_RT_attributed.dbc: Modified file to have a more meaningful and
variable network specifictation. Some attributes have been specified,
which demonstrate the support of send type and time. Sender and receiver
information, which was missing has been completed.

CAN_RT_simplified.dbc: Strongly shortened file. Useful only for
development purpose, to avoid very large files all the time.
