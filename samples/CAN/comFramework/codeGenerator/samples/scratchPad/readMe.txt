The file(s) in folder output were generated by the Java application
codeGenerator. The output has no particular purpose, this sample is just a
demonstration of the counting and arithmetics support.

The code generation can be repeated by running the Windows scripts
runDemoScratchPad.cmd from this working directory. Repeating the code
generation should be tried as kind of installation test of the
application.

If you want to run the application from another working folder then you
will have to modify the script: The Windows script references the required
resources by relative paths from here. Please, refer to
codeGenerator\doc\installation.txt, too.

All Windows scripts are trivial; porting them to Linux or Mac OS is
straightforward.
