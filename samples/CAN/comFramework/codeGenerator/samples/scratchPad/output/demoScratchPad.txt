Initially we have 0 numbers in the scratch pad.

We initialize number "hex" to the largest possible integer. Note, the hexadecimal number
representation is always positive. Printing this number decimal would show the negative
value from the two-complement's interpretation of the bit pattern.
hex = -1 = 0xffffffffffffffff
Now we have 1 number(s) in the scratch pad: hex

Negative numbers can be expressed by suffix n. This makes it most easy to assign positive
and negative literals to numbers. If the assignment is the first reference to a number then
it is created in the map. We set x to -16 and y to 23.

We copy the value of y into the new variable z and add z to x. Note, all operations are
done in place, trinary operations like a=b*c are not supported. (And there's no evident
reason for that, maybe we add it in a future refinement.) As a result we have x=7,
y=23 and z=23. More examples of the basic operations:

a=12, b=-3, a+b=9
a=12, b=-3, a-b=15
a=12, b=-3, a*b=-36
a=12, b=-3, a/b=-4
a=12, b=-5, a/b=-2

Hexadecimal literals are expressed by a leading 0x. They simplify the demonstration of the
binary operators:
a=0x12, b=0x7, a&b=0x2
a=0x12, b=0x7, a|b=0x17
a=0x12, b=0x7, a^b=0x15
a=0x12, ~a=0xffffffffffffffed
a=0x12, a<<5=0x240
a=0x12, a>>2=0x4
a=0x12, a>>>2=0x4 (>> means arithmetic shift, >>> means signless shift)
a=0x81234567abcdef01, a>>2=0xe048d159eaf37bc0
a=0x81234567abcdef01, a>>>2=0x2048d159eaf37bc0

The comparisons query numbers in the map but do not change them. The result is returned to
the template engine and needs to be evaluated by conditional template expressions. (Here, we
don't need conditional code as the StringTemplate V4 rendering of Booleans is just what we
need anyway):
a=12, b=-3
a==b is false
a!=b is true
a<b is false
a<=b is false
a>b is true
a>=b is true

a=12, b=12
a==b is true
a!=b is false
a<b is false
a<=b is true
a>b is false
a>=b is true

Please note, the default operand of all comparisons is null. You can check if number a is
negative by a simple <info.calc.a_isL>: a is positive.

Normally, and this is what we saw so far, reading the value of a number on the scratch pad
doesn't have an impact on the scratch pad contents. Sticky operations are those, which are
repeated every time immediately after the related number is read. This is how we implement
counters:
i=1
At this point, i has the value 2 in the map although we just before got 1 as result
from the read operation: the +1 operation has been repeated as side-effect but as
post-operation of the read. See the effect by repeatedly reading i:
i=2
i=3
i=4
i=5
For debbuging and other purpose it is still possible to read the internal value of i
without side-effect, another operator is applied. See here: i=6=6=6. However, using the
normal read-reference to i accurately continues counting by applying the sticky
post-operation:
i=6
i=7
i=8
i=9

For convenience only, we permit to omit parts of the commands, e.g., the operand or we
permit to read-reference a number without explicit initialization with the operator set.
Where a typical use case is seen, this is permitted. In other cases it is not permitted and
the code generator will fail with some explanatory feedback. The usual assumption is that a
template requires a linear counter. We can start a null based up counter by just
referencing a never explicitly created number:
neverUsedBefore=0
neverUsedBefore=1
neverUsedBefore=2
The sticky operation is cleared by any non sticky operation:
neverUsedBefore*1=3 (Sticky add is cleared by *1)
neverUsedBefore=3
neverUsedBefore=3
neverUsedBefore=3
The basic operation +,- and * can be sticky. We can easily implement up, down and
logarithmic counters. There's no sticky division.

To further support the counting we define the default values for the operations + and -
as 1 and for * as 2. (The latter because a logarithmic counter will in our context mostly
be needed as power-of-two counter.) Most other operations use the invariant number as
default. We don't encourage to make use of these default values.
  Please note, if a counter is created by first assigning the initial value and then applying
the count step as sticky operation then the initially assigned value needs to anticipate
and compensate for the preparatory first sticky operation. As an example we have an
upcounter from 5:
5
6
7
8
and a downcounter from 2:
2
1
0
-1
A power-of-two counter from one can't compensate for the first multiplication and needs to
rely on the defaults of the sticky multiplication:
1
2
4
8
This works for a power-of-3 counter, too:
1
3
9
27
Here, the concept reaches its limits. The implementation of a power-of-3 counter starting
at 2 would become much more cumbersome and requires a combination of scratch pad operations
and conditional template code. Or a sequence of scratch pad operations in each counting
step.

The introduction of the scratch pad breaks with a principal concept of the code generation
so far: The template engine just renders available, preprocessed data but doesn't do data
processing itself. This means for sub-templates that they can be used to generate some text
output, which is returned to the calling template for embedding it into the calling
template's own output. A sub-template can however not return anything but text, in
particular it can not return the result of a Boolean expression it computes. The following
template design fails by concept:

filterSentEventFrames(frame) ::= <<
<if(frame.isSent && frame.attribMap.frameSendMode.is.event)><true><else><false><endif>
>>

renderBus(bus) ::= <<
<bus.frameAry:{f|<if(filterSentEventFrames(f))><genCodeForSentEvFr(f)><endif>}>
>>

Although filterSentEventFrames tries to produce Boolean attributes (using <true> not true)
are these attributes not returned as such to the calling template. Instead, the Boolean
attribute is rendered as text as soon as the delimiting > is passed in template processing.
The if clause in the calling template tests either the text true or the text false and
both evaluates to true. No filtering takes place.

Using the scratch pad this design becomes an option. A sub-template can still not return
any information but text to the caller but it can leave a (numeric) result in the scratch
pad and the caller can reference it there. (It's even possible to let the sub-template
return a text fragment, which is used by the caller to reference the meant information in
the scratch pad.) Our example becomes:

filterSentEventFrames(frame) ::= <<
<if(frame.isSent && frame.attribMap.frameSendMode.is.event)><info.calc.isSentEvFr_set_1><else><info.calc.isSentEvFr_set_0><endif>
>>

genCodeForSentEvFr(f) ::= "<\n>Frame <f> is an outbound event frame"

renderBus(bus) ::= <<
<bus.frameAry:{f|<filterSentEventFrames(f)><if(info.calc.isSentEvFr_isG)><genCodeForSentEvFr(f)><endif>}>
>>

This is what our example produces:
Frame RT_DL1MK3_Measure_Time_10 is an outbound event frame

With the exception of counter support, the scratch pad would be useless if we wouldn't have
the possibility to operate on data from the CAN network database, i.e., on fields of the
data model. This is possible using the StringTemplate V4 map operator map.(<attribute>).
The name of the key into the map is computed by expanding <attribute>. We can easily use
the template contructs to let the template engine build any of the scratch pad commands
seen above; the required operand is the number literal we get from rendering a field of the
data model. Example:

The total number of frames is <cluster.noFrames>=7. We can combine the literal string
"noFrames_set_" with <cluster.noFrames> and get the valid assignment command noFrames_set_7
for the scratch pad. To make this run, we have to place the attribute
<info.calc.({noFrames_set_<cluster.noFrames>})> into our template. From now on a number
called noFrames exists in the scratch pad and can be referenced.

This pattern can be used for integer numbers and Booleans from the data model. It's still
possible for fields of type double or Double and using the formatter expression
format="%.0f" but this truncates the fraction of the number and won't be of much use.

Please note the global name space in the scratch pad. Different to in the data model are
numbers not related to a specific context or object. You might overcome this by building
number names from object names; <info.calc.({<bus.name>NoFrames_set_<bus.noFrames>})>
could for example be applied to get a bus related number of frames. While this is basically
correct it can easily fail due to the different syntax rules for symbol names: The data
model usually uses C style symbols, which may contain the underscore. The scratch pad can't
tolerate the underscore as it needs it to separate the number name from operation and
operand. It accepts any sequence beginning with a letter followed by letters and decimal
digits as number name. The previous example will work correctly only if the actual bus name
complies with this rule.

Operating on numeric fields of the data model together with the new concept of having
sub-templates as kind of sub-routines that compute and return data can be exploited to
separate the scratch pad constructs from the rest of the template. This improves
readability of the template and facilitates maintenance of the somewhat cumbersome scratch
pad constructs. Here's a "sub-routine" to check the range of an integer attribute from the
data model:

  // This template doesn't emit anything but it places the Boolean number inRange
  // into the global scratch pad, which indicates if x is element of [a,b].
  isInRange(x,a,b) ::= <<
  <info.calc.({x_set_<x>})><\>
  <info.calc.({a_set_<a>})><\>
  <info.calc.({b_set_<b>})><\>
  <if(info.calc.x_isGE_a && info.calc.x_isLE_b)><\>
    <info.calc.inRange_set_true><\>
  <else><\>
    <info.calc.inRange_set_false><\>
  <endif>
  >>

This is what it does (-1: true, 0: false):
isInRange(2,1,6)=-1
isInRange(9,1,6)=0
isInRange(1,1,6)=-1
isInRange(0,1,6)=0
isInRange(6,1,6)=-1
isInRange(7,1,6)=0
isInRange(-77777777,1,6)=0
isInRange(cluster.noFrames,1,6)=0
isInRange(cluster.noFrames,5,10)=-1

Another conceptual new element, which is enabled by the scratch pad is loop control.
StringTemplate V4 doesn't have explicit loops, but it permits recursion. By aborting a
recursion we actually get some kind of for or while loop. Note, that this can easily lead
to application abort because of stack overflow in case of a large number of cycles. As an
example, we generate a lookup table for 16 Bit bit masks:

uint16_t maskAry = 
{
    [0] = 0x0001,
    [1] = 0x0002,
    [2] = 0x0004,
    [3] = 0x0008,
    [4] = 0x0010,
    [5] = 0x0020,
    [6] = 0x0040,
    [7] = 0x0080,
    [8] = 0x0100,
    [9] = 0x0200,
    [10] = 0x0400,
    [11] = 0x0800,
    [12] = 0x1000,
    [13] = 0x2000,
    [14] = 0x4000,
    [15] = 0x8000,
}

Finally we have 16 numbers in the scratch pad:
  a = 5 = 0x5
  b = 10 = 0xa
  cnt = -2 = 0xfffffffffffffffe
  cntP2 = 16 = 0x10
  cntP3 = 81 = 0x51
  hex = -1 = 0xffffffffffffffff
  i = 10 = 0xa
  idx = 16 = 0x10
  inRange = -1 = 0xffffffffffffffff
  isSentEvFr = 1 = 0x1
  mask = 65536 = 0x10000
  neverUsedBefore = 3 = 0x3
  noFrames = 7 = 0x7
  x = 7 = 0x7
  y = 23 = 0x17
  z = 23 = 0x17
