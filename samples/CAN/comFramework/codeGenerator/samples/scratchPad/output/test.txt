Initially we have 1 numbers in the scratch pad.
We initialize number "hex".
Now we have 2 number(s) in the scratch pad: cnt1 hex
x=7
x=7
y=23
y=23
z=23
z=23
uint16 noFrames = 7;
#error x (-168) is out of range [0; 100]
#error x (-1) is out of range [0; 100]
#error x (101) is out of range [0; 100]
Finally we have 8 numbers in the scratch pad:
  cnt1 = 35 = 0x24
  hex = -1 = 0xffffffffffffffff
  noFrames = 7 = 0x7
  x = 101 = 0x65
  xBad = -1 = 0xffffffffffffffff
  xTooLarge = -1 = 0xffffffffffffffff
  y = -2 = 0xfffffffffffffffe
  z = 11 = 0xb
