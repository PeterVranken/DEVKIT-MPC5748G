 * @file types.h
 * Definition of primitive base types as used in the generated code. This file is part of
 * the sample but it is not generated. It serves as an example of such a basic header,
 * which is probably found in all embedded environments, where auto-generated sources files
 * are integrated.\n
 *   There's one specific issue with this file. The definition of the Boolean type needs to
 * resolve into an unsigned integer (as usual). The code generator handles signals of all
 * target types - including Boolean - uniquely by masking and shifting. Therefore, it'll
 * generate shift operations on Booleans, which is unacceptable for the abstract concept of
 * a Boolean but technically alright as long as the rule above is obeyed.
