<h1 data-number="1" id="comframework---code-generator"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> comFramework - Code Generator</h1>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This archive contains the binary distribution of the code generator from the comFramework project. The code generator can translate the information found in CAN network databases into nearly any textual representation and in particular into C source code, which is perfectly tailored to the needs of your specific (embedded) environment.</p>
<p>Interface implementations and particularly the often required pack and unpack functions for message composition from signals and decomposition into signals can be generated.</p>
<p>However, C source code is just one out of a long list of useful representations. You can render the information also as:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML or LaTeX for documentation</li>
<li>Excel Spreadsheet (*.csv only)</li>
<li>Various XML formats like AUTOSAR arxml or TargetLink configuration files</li>
<li>M Scripts for the MathWorks Embedded Coder configuration</li>
<li>A2L files for support of calibration interfaces</li>
<li>Python, Perl or other interpreted languages for whatever purpose</li>
</ul>
<p>In- and output description are decoupled in the parametrization of the tool. First you will specify a set of CAN network databases (*.dbc files). All of these are parsed and merged to one large data structure. The use case of merging several databases is the code generation for network nodes, which are connected to several buses. (Merging different databases is of limited value if they are inhomogeneous with respect to the use of attributes. If the evaluation of frame properties like send period and transmission characteristics becomes quite different on different buses then it might be better to run the code generator several times and let it generate differently designed source files.)</p>
<p>Secondary, you will define a list of output files. The specification of each output file is associated with the specification of a StringTemplate V4 template file. The template controls the output generation and this is how the same information is rendered once as C source code and once as Embedded Coder interface description (just to put it into an example).</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="documentation"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Documentation</h2>
<h3 data-number="1.2.1" id="command-line-interface-of-code-generator"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Command line interface of code generator</h3>
<p>The usage of the tool is explained in the usage text: Begin with running the code generator with command line option <code>--help</code>. The same information can be found on-line and a bit more in detail on the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/comframe/wiki/Command%20Line%20DBC%20Code%20Generator/">project Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>The command line interface of the code generator has the following concept:</p>
<p>The arguments form groups. A group of successive arguments can specify an input file, another group can specify another input file or an output file and so on. The beginning of a group of arguments is recognized by a specific argument, the principal argument of the group. The usage text typically says “this argument opens the context of …”. Naturally, the same command line switches can be repeatedly used, once in each group of same kind.</p>
<p>Additionally to the use of command line switches in the context of a group, one can put the same prior to opening the first group context: Now they have the character of a default value for all later groups, which do not themselves specify these particular arguments.</p>
<p>Finally, there are “traditional” command line arguments, which relate to the run of the application as a whole, like logging and verbosity settings.</p>
<p>Please note, different to the common GNU command line interface this application demands a blank between the switch and its value. For example -oMyOutputFile.c would be rejected, whereas -o MyOutputFile.c would be the correct specification of a generated output file.</p>
<p>The application’s command line options mainly relate to the definition of in- and output files. The rest is the internal representation of the read input data and the way it is rendered in the output files. The next sections explain the available, related documentation.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.2" id="the-data-model"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> The data model</h3>
<p>The internal representation of the parsed input information is documented as a <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/codeGenerator/trunk/doc/dataModel/index.html" title="dataModelForStringTemplateV4.html">Javadoc of the complete data structure</a>.</p>
<p>Here, you find the documentation of all public elements of the data structure that are accessible from the StringTemplate V4 templates. The data structure is deeply nested, and actually, it are even two data structures, which are passed to the rendering process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parsed information forms an object of class Cluster</li>
<li>The information about output files plus some environmental information is put into an object of class Info</li>
</ul>
<p>You will study the Javadoc pages to see, which pieces of information to be used from within a template.</p>
<p>Another source for this knowledge is the investigation of the sample templates: codeGenerator/samples/…/*.stg.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.3" id="the-stringtemplate-v4-templates"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> The StringTemplate V4 templates</h3>
<p>The technique of rendering the information held in a Cluster and an Info object is well documented. The two objects are passed to the StringTemplate V4 template engine and this engine is fully documented. Please refer to <a href="http://www.stringtemplate.org/" class="uri">http://www.stringtemplate.org/</a> or find a printable version of the documentation as <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/codeGenerator/trunk/doc/ST4-270115-0836-52.pdf" class="uri">https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/codeGenerator/trunk/doc/ST4-270115-0836-52.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Please note, as a matter of experience, you will have to read the StringTemplate V4 documentation entirely before you can start to successfully develop your first useful template. StringTemplate V4 is powerful and convenient but not self-explaining.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.3" id="installation"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Installation</h2>
<p>The code generator is a Java 7 application. The installation is as simple as unpacking an archive and setting an environment variable. It is described in detail in the file <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/codeGenerator/trunk/doc/installation.txt">installation.txt</a>.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.4" id="whats-new"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> What’s new</h2>
<h3 data-number="1.4.1" id="release-1.10.4"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Release 1.10.4</h3>
<p>The code generator has been migrated to the recently issued revisions of StringTemplate and ANTLR, 4.3.1 and 4.8, respectively.</p>
<p>The only noticeable difference should be a fix of the white space handling in StringTemplate. In all revisions so far, it used to be very difficult to precisely control the generation of blank lines in the output. With this fix, the handling of newline characters in templates became more transparent. In particular, this relates to leading and trailing newlines in sub-templates.</p>
<p>Caution, this means that this version of the code generator can produce different output with existing templates. The differences are however limited to blank lines and should not matter in C code generation environments.</p>
<p>The support of CAN FD has been improved. The frame size of CAN messages is checked against the allowed CAN FD frame sizes. The data model has been extended by the data length code (DLC). The new data model has revision 1010.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.2" id="release-1.10"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Release 1.10</h3>
<p>Error handling improved. Firstly, internal errors of StringTemplate V4 during rendering are now streamlined with the application logging. Before, they were printed in the log (together with the bulky but in the given context meaningless Java stack frame) but were not recognized or counted by the application.</p>
<p>Secondly, error counting has been aligned with the other application excelExporter. A summary note is printed at the end of the application run, which reports the total number of errors and warnings in all parse and output generation steps. Moreover, if the total number is not zero then the application now ends with exit value one, which facilitates proper integration of the code generator into an automated build environment.</p>
<p>Note: There’s no change of the data model. It remains at revision designation 1009.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.3" id="release-1.9"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.3</span> Release 1.9</h3>
<p>The data model class Signal gets a new field, which permits a template to find out if the signal is a particular “special” signal, like checksum or sequence counter.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.4" id="release-1.8"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.4</span> Release 1.8</h3>
<p>New feature: A new command line argument, invert-transmission-direction, supports code generation for a node, which implements residual bus simulation. If the argument is given then the transmission direction of frames and signals is inverted in the data model. A new field in the data model, Bus.isTransmissionDirectionInverted, makes this behavior transparent to the templates.</p>
<p>Inverse sort orders have been added for the bus’s frame array and documentation of sorting became much more accurate; it used to not mention all supported sort orders.</p>
<p>Frame sort order sendFirst has been renamed to sentFirst, which means a not backward compatible change of the data model. Existing templates may fail to do expected frame sorting with this revision of the code generator!</p>
<p>The signal lists of the PDUs are now sorted; before the order of appearance of signal specifications in the network database files had been retained. This normalizations makes code generation more stable against equivalent changes of the network database files. Normal signals and signals in multiplexed sets of those are now sorted according to their location in the PDU (ascending order of start bit). The multiplexed sets of signals are sorted according to ascending order of selector value.</p>
<p>The named values of a signal are now sorted according to ascending numeric values.</p>
<p>Bug fix: The named value lists of a signal had been wrong in that the value names were put in quotes. Now the quotes are removed and the true name of a signal value is put into the data model.</p>
<p>Bug fix: The Embedded Coder sample had generated the conversion macros binary-value-to-world-value and vice versa only for signals, which are either sent or received by the node. This was inconsistent with the generation of signal initialization code, which had been generated for all the signals of a frame. The initialization code may depend on the conversion macros. Now, the templates generate the conversion macros for all signals, even those, which are not transmitted by the node.</p>
<p>The interface descriptions for AUTOSAR, Embedded Coder, TargetLink and ASAM 2-MC generated by the samples will now list all signals of a transmitted frame. So far, only sent and received signals had been listed. Although this is basically correct was it found to be hindering because many real network databases don’t specify senders and receivers properly for all frames and signals.</p>
<p>Bug fix: A misplaced <em>&lt;endif&gt;</em> has been found in template cap_canApi.c.stg of the Embedded Coder sample. The #define’s that make min and max of a signal public were only generated for scaled signals. This was not by intention, min and max are as useful for unscaled integers. Now, the min and max values are available as #define for all signals.</p>
<p>Bug fix: The same misplaced <em>&lt;endif&gt;</em> let to unwanted suppression of parts of the Embedded Coder interface. For unscaled integers was the chosen storage class mechanism not generated.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.5" id="release-1.7"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.5</span> Release 1.7</h3>
<p>DBC Parser: User attributes and named signal values now support the full signed and unsigned 32 Bit integer range from -2^31 till 2^32-1. Before, the parser’s implementation had used the Java type int, which limited the positive range to 2^31-1.</p>
<p>Some more fields in the data model class Signal facilitate the handling of multiplexed signals. Although a rather minor change demands the change of the data model the increase of the second field of the revision number.</p>
<p>A new sample, EmbeddedCoderAPIWithBusStruct, demonstrates how to perfectly integrate a comFramework based CAN interface with model based APSW design and Embedded Coder based code generation from a Simulink model.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.6" id="release-1.6"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.6</span> Release 1.6</h3>
<p>The DBC parser has been made more tolerant against typical mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attribute names may use the actually forbidden hyphen. The parser replaces the hyphens with underscores, emits a warning only and continues</li>
<li>Missing attribute default values had been reported as an error. They are now reported as warning only if all affected objects got an individual value</li>
<li>Invalid CAN IDs are now reported only once, not at every occurrence</li>
</ul>
<p>The environmental part of the data model, StringTemplate V4 attribute info, has two new elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The StringTemplate V4 template engine has been connected to the Log4j application logger. A template can emit messages on debug, info, warn and error level. The latter two are counted and code generation won’t take place if there are errors. This way, a template can report invalid states and hinder the template engine to regardless generate code</li>
<li>A numeric scratch pad is available. Numeric operations, including comparisons and binary operations, can be applied to numeric fields of the data model. This means a new level of conditional code generation and opens some new structural possibilities</li>
</ul>
<p>A new sample, <em>scratchPad</em>, demonstrates the capabilities and the usage of the new scratch pad. Please have a look at the <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/codeGenerator/trunk/samples/scratchPad/output/demoScratchPad.txt">generated output</a> to get a first impression.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.7" id="release-1.5"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.7</span> Release 1.5</h3>
<p>The data model now offers sorted lists of frames. A template can iterate along all frames in lexical order of their names or in numerical order of ID or in parsing i.e. file order. In all cases the iteration can be done in both directions.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.8" id="release-1.4"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.8</span> Release 1.4</h3>
<p>A minor extension of the data model for sake of template design: The description of a signal’s bit pattern in the PDU is supported by additional redundant but convenient fields. See <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/codeGenerator/trunk/doc/dataModel/index.html">Javadoc</a> of Java class Signal.</p>
<p>Fix: The log file contained a few bad end of line characters, which let to a mixture of UNIX and Windows style.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.9" id="release-1.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.9</span> Release 1.3</h3>
<p>Our understanding of multiplexed signals turned out to be wrong. Release 1.2 and before only permitted alternative signals, where alternative sets of signals is the true intention. The according change of the data model required the increment of the minor version number.</p>
<h4 data-number="1.4.9.1" id="fix-1.3.4"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.9.1</span> Fix 1.3.4</h4>
<p>Revision 1.3.3 had been released with a bug in one of its core sample templates. This bug has been fixed in 1.3.4. The source code of the code generator itself has not been modified but we changed the third field of its revision designation because of the high impact of this issue: Most people will use the sample templates as starting point for their application and would suffer from the inherited bug in the template.</p>
<p>The bug was located and is fixed in the template <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/codeGenerator/trunk/samples/raceTechnology/templates/lib/codeGenC.stg" title="SVN repository">codeGenC.stg</a>.</p>
<p>However, the complete set of templates should be exchanged for consistency reasons. The introduction of the support template <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/codeGenerator/trunk/samples/raceTechnology/templates/lib/iterations.stg" title="SVN repository">iterations.stg</a> had established the attribute name <em>signal</em> for signals. Earlier templates used to refer to <em>s</em> to address to the signal in scope. This has now been aligned and all templates use the attribute name <em>signal</em>.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.10" id="release-1.2"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.10</span> Release 1.2</h3>
<p>An unpleasant bug fix: The code itself was alright but there were two too strict assertions in the code of release 1.1, which let the program abort depending on the network database. One assertion would fire in case of a specific error in the network file but the other one for each input file not defining any frame related attribute - which is a quite common situation. Release 1.1 would run if the Java machine is not started with assertion support (-ea).</p>
<p>The release number has been incremented not because of the fixes but since the data model has been polished. All objects now support the method <em>toString</em> so that they can be rendered in a template by themselves, e.g. <em>&lt;frame&gt;</em> will render a complete frame object. The default behavior is to render an object as its name, <em>&lt;frame&gt;</em> would be identical to <em>&lt;frame.name&gt;</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the availability of get-number-of-element methods has been harmonized; they should now be available for all the collections in the data model. The StringTemplate V4 operator <em>&lt;length()&gt;</em> is probably no longer required.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.11" id="release-1.1"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.11</span> Release 1.1</h3>
<p>This release appeared already two weeks after the first release. By chance we found a side note in the StringTemplate V4 documentation mentioning the support of Java Map objects. This led to a redesign of the handling of CAN DBC attributes and the special signals. The data model has been changed. The functionality is exactly the same but the usage (i.e. the required template constructs) is much more intuitive. The sample template file attributes.stg disappeared; it was a convenience file to compensate for the somewhat cumbersome earlier approach.</p>
<p>Having Java Map available it became now possible to implement an earlier idea, user specified options or, with other words, template attributes. Arbitrary attributes of Boolean, numerical or string type can be defined on the command line and are put into the rendered data model. The code generation process can be controlled by user specified command line options.</p>
<p>CAUTION: This revision will fail if run with assertion checking. See next revision for details.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.12" id="release-1.0"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.12</span> Release 1.0</h3>
<p>The initial release. Full functionality of code generation but preliminary state of samples and documentation.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.5" id="the-comframework-project"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> The comFramework project</h2>
<p>The code generator is only a part of the comFramework projects, which embeds the code generator into the concept of a highly reusable, flexibly integratable CAN interface. comFramework can be found at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/comframe/" class="uri">https://sourceforge.net/projects/comframe/</a>.</p>
