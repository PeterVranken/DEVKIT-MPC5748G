<h1 id="comframework-1.4-r298-12.09.2018"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> comFramework 1.4 (r298, 12.09.2018)</h1>
<h2 id="about-this-project"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> About this project</h2>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/comframe">This project</a> presents a flexible, widely customizable CAN communication interface for embedded applications. It binds signal based application code to the frame based hardware layer. It covers the CAN stack from the application layer down to the hardware driver layer (not including).</p>
<p>The interface implementation is code generator supported; the dedicated API with the application software and the unpack/pack functions for message (de)composition can be generated from information in the network databases. A sample integration demonstrates, how to generate much more: Setting initial signal values, DLC check, checksum generation/validation, sequence counter generation/validation and the implementation of different timing patterns is generated in a fully automated fashion. Attributes defined in the DBC file(s) support the automation.</p>
<p>We call this project a framework since the interface should be considered a suggestion only; the high flexibility of the code generation process makes it easy to design different interface architectures, which can reach a similar degree of automation with respect to changes of the network database(s).</p>
<h3 id="the-can-interface"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> The CAN interface</h3>
<p>The operational core of the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/comframe/wiki/The%20CAN%20Interface/">CAN interface</a> is a dispatcher engine that decouples the one or more interrupts, which are typically used by the CAN hardware driver for notification of send or receive events, from the application task(s); this makes the complete data processing at the application side safe, straightforward, race condition free programming.</p>
<p>The dispatcher implements a generic concept of events and notifications by callbacks. Among more, events can be interrupts from the hardware layer or timer events. The callback functions use the timer and other events to model the transmission timing patterns of the frames and to generate timeout information.</p>
<p>The callbacks are external to the dispatcher engine. They are either auto-coded from the DBC files (this is what the samples demonstrate) or they can be hand-coded and would then operate on data tables, which are auto-coded from the DBC files.</p>
<p>Any number of dispatcher objects can be instantiated in order to support multi-threading architectures in a transparent and convenient way.</p>
<h3 id="the-dbc-code-generator"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> The DBC code generator</h3>
<p>The code generator consists of an open source parser for CAN network database files (*<em>.dbc</em> or DBC files) with connected general purpose code generator. The idea is most simple and most flexible:</p>
<p>The parser transforms the DBC files into an internal data representation, which holds all information about the network. This data structure is a special form of the parse tree. The structure has been chosen such that it is compatible with the template engine StringTemplate V4 by Terence Parr, see <a href="http://www.stringtemplate.org/" class="uri">http://www.stringtemplate.org/</a>. This template engine is capable to render deeply nested data structures and it can therefore transform the parse tree in nearly any kind of textual representation. This explains the high flexibility/customizability of the whole system.</p>
<p>Just by configuring the templates, the code generator can produce different useful representations of the information in the network files, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>An HTML report with all frames, signals, attributes and all the properties of these</li>
<li>An Excel file with all the same (however, only as *<em>.csv</em>)</li>
<li>C source code and related header files, which implement a CAN interface. The interface will contain the needed data structures, timing related frame processing, validation code and pack and unpack operations to transform signal sets to frames and vice versa. The implementation can be made specific to a particular platform’s requirements</li>
<li>LaTeX source code for documentation of the interface</li>
<li>Interface definition files: If code from a model based code generation environment is linked to the CAN interface (e.g. MathWorks MATLAB with either their Embedded Coder or with dSPACE TargetLink) then a descripition of the signal interface is essential as these code generators need to be aware of the signal sets and their properties, data types and scaling in the first place. Our code generator can generate the required M scripts or XML files</li>
<li>ASAM MCD-2 MC interface description files (*<em>.a2l</em>) if the target platform shall be connected to a measurement and calibration tool like ETAS INCA or Vector Informatik CANape</li>
<li>AUTOSAR specification code (*<em>.arxml</em>). The DBC file contents can be rendered as an AUTOSAR software component, which connects to the ISignals of the COM stack, including all required application data types with scaling and more information</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dbc-parser"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> DBC parser</h3>
<p>In most automation environments our code generator can be used as raw DBC parser for whatever purpose, too. Typically, interpreted languages like Perl, Python or Octave’s M script are applied in software automation environments. If you use any interpreted language then you can configure the code generator to render the information in the syntax of your scripting language. Run the code generator, run the generated script and have the information in the context of your automation environment. The configuration of the code generation can be tailored; you will just render those parts of the information you really need. No need to develop the most complex all embracing data structure. A simple <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/comframe/wiki/Reusage%20and%20standalone%20usage%20of%20DBC%20parser/#example-the-code-generator-as-dbc-parser-for-gnu-octave-m">example for GNU Octave</a> is provided.</p>
<h3 id="excelexporter-as-auxiliary-code-generator"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> excelExporter as auxiliary code generator</h3>
<p>A second, auxiliary code generator is part of the framework. This is the Java application excelExporter. The idea is nearly the same as for the main code generator but the input is a set of Excel workbooks instead of DBC files. The parse tree can be as simple as a linear list of rows from a flat table or a as complex as a deeply nested tree of interrelated data items. The concrete data structure depends on the definition of the input. The parse tree is rendered by the StringTemplate V4 template engine, identical to what has been said for the DBC code generator. The intented use case of the auxiliary code generator excelExporter is to support the handling of interfaces. Excel files serve as data dictionary of signals, variables, diagnostic interface items, etc. and can be translated into C/C++ interface implementations, documentation, ASAM MCD-2 MC or AUTOSAR interface specifications, etc.</p>
<h2 id="status-of-the-project"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Status of the project</h2>
<p>The project is ready for productive use.</p>
<ul>
<li>The CAN interface with its dispatcher engine is distributed as source code; concept and how-to-use are documented in this <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/comframe/wiki/The%20CAN%20Interface/">Wiki page</a></li>
<li>Three compilable and runnable sample integrations of the CAN interface are distributed with source code and makefiles together with the dispatcher engine. There’s a Windows integration, an Arduino ATmega 2560 real time integration and an integration with the MathWorks Embedded Coder</li>
<li>The code generators are distributed as Java application. A number of samples for the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/comframe/code/HEAD/tree/codeGenerator/trunk/samples/">DBC code generator</a> and for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/comframe/code/HEAD/tree/excelExporter/trunk/samples/">excelExporter</a> demonstrate how templates can look like, which do the transformations mentioned above</li>
<li>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/comframe/files">download page</a> at SourceForge provides a ZIP archive for download, which bundles all needed tools, files and samples in a ready-to-use folder structure. The archive contains the files of revision r298 (12.09.2018 22:48:42) of the SourceForge <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/comframe/code/HEAD/tree">SVN repository</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Support of the project is appreciated to support more kinds of network databases. For now, we are restricted to the DBC format. However, this format looses importance. New formats like FIBEX will probably supersede DBC in the future. Furthermore, different physical bus systems have different network database files, like *<em>.ldf</em> for LIN communication. Parsers for these input formats are required and - what’s more difficult - a common data model for all of these buses and network files needs to be developed so that the parser becomes a configurable choice but the templates can be kept widely independent of the input format.</p>
