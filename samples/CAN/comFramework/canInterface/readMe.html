<p>This is the implementation of the comFramework CAN interface engine.</p>
<p>Folder <code>code</code> contains the source code of the engine. There are no other files, particularly no build scripts as the interface engine is intended for integration into a real project as source code. The files from this folder are typically added to an existing build project for the aimed target platform.</p>
<p>Folder <code>sampleIntegrations</code> contains source code and build scripts for several demo applications of the CAN interface. The reproduction of the build requires a particular build tool chain; out of the box we use Arduino 1.8 and MinGW GCC for Windows.</p>
<p>Please refer to the project Wiki with the documentation of the CAN interface and the readMe files of the available sample integrations for details:</p>

<h1 data-number="2" id="whats-new"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> What’s new</h1>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="release-2.0"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Release 2.0</h2>
<p>An redesign of the software’s class model has been made. It targets at enlarging the number of supported integration use cases. It’s now straight forward to integrate into fully memory protected or managed systems or to operated closer to the CAN hardware, with leaner software buffering strategies.</p>
<p>Let’s first have a look at revision 1.x. There is a single global (and implicit) instance of the whole. It has any number of event dispatchers and each dispatcher has one event queue and one handle map, which associates the external events got via the queue with the internally registered event sources.</p>
<p>In revision 2.0, the “whole” thing of 1.x becomes the new dispatcher system. Any number of such systems can be created. A system has any number of dispatchers.</p>
<p>Revision 2.0 introduces interfaces and implementations of those. A dispatcher no longer has an event queue. Instead, it now has any number of event receiver ports and these ports can connect to an arbitrary implementation of the event receiver interface.</p>
<p>The additional definition of an event sender interface allows the implementation of “connectors”, which have both types of ports: Events can be submitted via the connector’s sender port and the dispatcher can consume the submitted events if one of its ports is connected to the connector’s receiver port. The event queue implementation known from revision 1.x is now available as such a connector object.</p>
<p>The new sender object has a sender port and provides an API, which strongly resembles the event posting API of the 1.x dispatcher: Creating a sender, a connector-queue and a dispatcher and connecting them in chain yields a configuration, which is compatible with the monolithic construct of revision 1.x.</p>
<p>The malloc API of 1.x has been substituted by a memory pool interface. The different objects can be created from the same or from different memory pool instances - which is the concept to support memory protected or managed systems.</p>
<p>Of course, to facilitate the code migration, the malloc API implementation known from 1.x is now available as an implementation of the memory pool interface.</p>
<p>Handle mapping has always been a major issue in integrating the CAN interface. Already 1.x had used an interface to connect to a map instance in order to allow arbitrary mapping strategies. This has been even more generalized and a number of map implementations is provided, which should cover all existing use cases.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="release-1.5"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Release 1.5</h2>
<p>A new, abstract event source has been offered for the dispatcher mechanism. It can be applied for posting events, which are not directly related to a particular CAN bus or frame. Use case are events from some application code, which relate somehow to the CAN communication, but which are not as prototypical as e.g. a frame Rx/Tx or bus-off event.</p>
<p>Note, this extension means an incompatible change of the existing API cde_initModule(). Existing code won’t compile.</p>
<p>Better support of CAN FD by a new queue implementation. The new implementation can save a significant amount of RAM if events of varying size are processed. The elder implementation allocated a fixed amount of memory for each event, which means a waste of memory particularly for CAN FD, where the majority of frames still have up to eight Byte but a few of 64 Byte need to be handled, too.</p>
<p>Major bug fix: The CAN interface used to represent CAN IDs as an ordinary integer number, disregarding whether it were a standard 11 Bit or an extended 29 Bit ID. Now it uses a struct with two fields to store numeric value and kind of ID independently.</p>
<p>Note, this repair means an incompatible API change of the CAN interface engine. Existing code won’t compile. Moreover, the templates of typical comFramework client projects will require adaptation to serve the new data type for CAN IDs.</p>
<p>The sample code for Windows has been migrated to a recent revision of MinGW GCC (8.1.0, 32 Bit and 64 Bit).</p>
<p>There are some minor bug fixes of the sample code and the makefiles.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="release-1.4"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Release 1.4</h2>
<p>New commonly usable templates have been added to the project-independent library template file codeGenC.stg: bitMask and bitMaskCalc to provide bit masks for typical signal operations.</p>
<p>The documentation has been improved and there are some minor bug fixes of the sample code and the makefiles.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.4" id="release-1.3"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Release 1.3</h2>
<p>The implementation of the CAN interface engine (also referred to as dispatcher engine) makes use of a new implementation of the thread-safe dispatcher queue. The API is unchanged and existing code building on 1.2.1 will be compilable without modifications and it’ll show unchanged behavior.</p>
<p>The new queue no longer makes any restrictions on thread priorities. It is a lock-free implementation that can run in any multi-threaded or multi-core environment. The elder implementation required that the a CAN event notifying execution context (a CAN interrupt usually) had a higher priority than and could never be preempted by the execution context of the CAN consuming APSW code. This is the normal situation on any single-core RTOS platform but not beyond. Now, the sources of CAN events and the receiving APSW tasks can run on different cores or in different threads of arbitrary priority and with arbitrary scheduling scheme.</p>
<p>A new test application runs the CAN interface in a POSIX multi-threading environment. Dispatcher queues connect several tasks, which can all preempt one another and which are not restricted to run on a single core.</p>
<p>The new test application is at the same time a new sample integration, which demonstrates how to design a different, more conventional architecture of the CAN interface and how to let the code generator generate CRC based end-to-end protection functions for CAN frames.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.5" id="release-1.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Release 1.2.1</h2>
<p>The thread safe implementation of the event queue has been supported by a memory barrier between data manipulation and acknowledge. This might be necessary on particular platforms. A platform dependent #define becomes element of the configuration.</p>
<p>Bug fix: All sample integrations’ templates had generated the conversion macros binary-value-to-world-value and vice versa only for signals, which are either sent or received by the node. This was inconsistent with the generation of signal initialization code, which had been generated for all the signals of a frame. The initialization code may depend on the conversion macros. Now, the templates generate the conversion macros for all signals, even those, which are not transmitted by the node.</p>
<p>The interface descriptions for Embedded Coder and TargetLink generated by the samples will now list all signals of a transmitted frame. So far, only sent and received signals had been listed. Although this is basically correct was it found to be hindering because many real network databases don’t specify senders and receivers properly for all frames and signals.</p>
<p>Bug fix: A misplaced &lt;endif&gt; was found in the sample integrations’ templates. The #define’s that make minimum and maximum of a signal public were only generated for scaled signals. This was not by intention, minimum and maximum are as useful for unscaled integers. Now, the minimum and maximum values are available as #define for all signals.</p>
<p>Bug fix: The same misplaced &lt;endif&gt; let to unwanted suppression of parts of the Embedded Coder interface. For unscaled integers was the chosen storage class mechanism not generated. This affects only the Arduino Embedded Coder sample.</p>
