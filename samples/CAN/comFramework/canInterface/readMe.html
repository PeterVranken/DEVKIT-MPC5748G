<p>This is the implementation of the comFramework CAN interface engine. There are no other files, particularly no build scripts as the interface engine is intended for integration into a real project as source code.</p>

<h1 data-number="2" id="whats-new"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> What’s new</h1>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="release-1.6"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Release 1.6</h2>
<p>Under development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architectural redesign
<ul>
<li>Concept of allocating objects to specific, well-defined memories</li>
<li>Support of memory protected environments</li>
<li>Better support of different environments with respect to task, process, multi-core architectures</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Little functional changes</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="release-1.5"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Release 1.5</h2>
<p>A new, abstract event source has been offered for the dispatcher mechanism. It can be applied for posting events, which are not directly related to a particular CAN bus or frame. Use case are events from some application code, which relate somehow to the CAN communication, but which are not as prototypical as e.g. a frame Rx/Tx or bus-off event.</p>
<p>Note, this extension means an incompatible change of the existing API cde_initModule(). Existing code won’t compile.</p>
<p>Better support of CAN FD by a new queue implementation. The new implementation can save a significant amount of RAM if events of varying size are processed. The elder implementation allocated a fixed amount of memory for each event, which means a waste of memory particularly for CAN FD, where the majority of frames still have up to eight Byte but a few of 64 Byte need to be handled, too.</p>
<p>Major bug fix: The CAN interface used to represent CAN IDs as an ordinary integer number, disregarding whether it were a standard 11 Bit or an extended 29 Bit ID. Now it uses a struct with two fields to store numeric value and kind of ID independently.</p>
<p>Note, this repair means an incompatible API change of the CAN interface engine. Existing code won’t compile. Moreover, the templates of typical comFramework client projects will require adaptation to serve the new data type for CAN IDs.</p>
<p>The sample code for Windows has been migrated to a recent revision of MinGW GCC (8.1.0, 32 Bit and 64 Bit).</p>
<p>There are some minor bug fixes of the sample code and the makefiles.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="release-1.4"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Release 1.4</h2>
<p>New commonly usable templates have been added to the project-independent library template file codeGenC.stg: bitMask and bitMaskCalc to provide bit masks for typical signal operations.</p>
<p>The documentation has been improved and there are some minor bug fixes of the sample code and the makefiles.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.4" id="release-1.3"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Release 1.3</h2>
<p>The implementation of the CAN interface engine (also referred to as dispatcher engine) makes use of a new implementation of the thread-safe dispatcher queue. The API is unchanged and existing code building on 1.2.1 will be compilable without modifications and it’ll show unchanged behavior.</p>
<p>The new queue no longer makes any restrictions on thread priorities. It is a lock-free implementation that can run in any multi-threaded or multi-core environment. The elder implementation required that the a CAN event notifying execution context (a CAN interrupt usually) had a higher priority than and could never be preempted by the execution context of the CAN consuming APSW code. This is the normal situation on any single-core RTOS platform but not beyond. Now, the sources of CAN events and the receiving APSW tasks can run on different cores or in different threads of arbitrary priority and with arbitrary scheduling scheme.</p>
<p>A new test application runs the CAN interface in a POSIX multi-threading environment. Dispatcher queues connect several tasks, which can all preempt one another and which are not restricted to run on a single core.</p>
<p>The new test application is at the same time a new sample integration, which demonstrates how to design a different, more conventional architecture of the CAN interface and how to let the code generator generate CRC based end-to-end protection functions for CAN frames.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.5" id="release-1.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Release 1.2.1</h2>
<p>The thread safe implementation of the event queue has been supported by a memory barrier between data manipulation and acknowledge. This might be necessary on particular platforms. A platform dependent #define becomes element of the configuration.</p>
<p>Bug fix: All sample integrations’ templates had generated the conversion macros binary-value-to-world-value and vice versa only for signals, which are either sent or received by the node. This was inconsistent with the generation of signal initialization code, which had been generated for all the signals of a frame. The initialization code may depend on the conversion macros. Now, the templates generate the conversion macros for all signals, even those, which are not transmitted by the node.</p>
<p>The interface descriptions for Embedded Coder and TargetLink generated by the samples will now list all signals of a transmitted frame. So far, only sent and received signals had been listed. Although this is basically correct was it found to be hindering because many real network databases don’t specify senders and receivers properly for all frames and signals.</p>
<p>Bug fix: A misplaced &lt;endif&gt; was found in the sample integrations’ templates. The #define’s that make minimum and maximum of a signal public were only generated for scaled signals. This was not by intention, minimum and maximum are as useful for unscaled integers. Now, the minimum and maximum values are available as #define for all signals.</p>
<p>Bug fix: The same misplaced &lt;endif&gt; let to unwanted suppression of parts of the Embedded Coder interface. For unscaled integers was the chosen storage class mechanism not generated. This affects only the Arduino Embedded Coder sample.</p>
