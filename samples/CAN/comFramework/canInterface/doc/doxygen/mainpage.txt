@section secIntro Introduction

comFramework - CAN Interface - A highly flexible CAN interface for embedded platforms

This is not the manual. The purpose of this documentation is to be a kind
of API browser to support the implementation of the software, which is
going to integrate the CAN interface. Get a quick overview on the source
files of the interface engine and the contained functions and applied data
types. Use it as a reference book while working on your embedding
software.

For everything else, please refer to the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/comframe/wiki/Home/">comFramework Wiki pages</a>.
