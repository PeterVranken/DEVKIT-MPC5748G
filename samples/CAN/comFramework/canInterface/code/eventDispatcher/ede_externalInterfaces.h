/** The interface of a map, which associates the sender's identification of an event with
    the internally used zero based index. The implementation of the map is done externally
    as part of the integration, here we just specify the interface of the required map.\n
      The map is used for lookup of two kinds of indexes:\n
      1. Use case mapping external events to registered event sources:\n
      The map's function addKeyValuePair() is internally called by the dispatcher engine
    on each registration of an event source, i.e., ede_registerEventSource(). This way, the
    map is built up.\n
      The map's function getValue() is internally called by the dispatcher engine on
    reception of an external event in order to associate the received event data with the
    causing, registered event source.\n
      2. Use case mapping external evemts to a sender's port:\n
    The map associates an abstract event handle with a sender's port (addressed by index),
    which the event is posted to. Using an externally defined map to decide the port to
    use, allows the external code to control/define the communication structure. (The
    generic implementation of the event dispatcher does not make any assumption about the
    communication paths.) In this use case, only the map lookup operation is used, in the
    operation to post an event, i.e., ede_postEvent(). The implementation of sender and
    dispatcher don't take care of building up the map. */

     * ede_registerEventSource().\n
     *   May be NULL. In many environments, the required map is trivial (e.g. the identity)
     * or known (and generated as ROM table) and no code is required to built-up the map.\n
     *   2. Use case mapping external evemts to a sender's port:\n
     *   The function is currently not called by the dispatcher engine or sender
     * implementation. The integration code is in charge of providing the map contents and
     * it may or may not make use of this function to buildup the map.\n
     *   May be NULL to indicate that operation is not required.\n

     * event" and sender handle is CAN message ID.

     *   @param mapValue
     * The value of the pair to add to the map. This value needs to be returned by
     * getValue() if the same event characterization is provided.\n
