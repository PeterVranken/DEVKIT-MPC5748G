/**
 * @file mem_malloc.c
 * The memory allocation unit, which is the basis of the concept of static, deterministic
 * memory allocation: A given chunk of memory of limited, known size is partitioned and
 * distributed on demand. The idea is most simple. Each caller gets the demanded piece of
 * memory until the initial chunk of memory is exhausted. There's no method to free
 * allocated memory again and therefore all typical heap problems with fragmentation and
 * undeterministic timing are strictly avoided. A deterministic run-time behavior of the
 * client code is ensured. The application, which uses this allocation needs of course be
 * aware of the concept. It must e.g. not permit to destroy objects or to re-initialize
 * some data structures. Instead it needs to implement concepts like one-time
 * initialization and object pools for reuse.

 * actual operation of memory allocation to ensure atomicity of the operation (and if
 * requested, see mem_malloc()). The specified guard function needs to be suitable to
 * mutually exclude all contexts competing for the given memory pool.\n
 *   One should pass \a NULL in a single threaded environment or if the newly created
 * memory pool object won't ever be used in concurrent contexts.

 * The function writes (only) to the specified new pool memory. Therefore, it needs to be
