/**
 * @file mu8_mapDirectLookupU8.c
 * This module provides a simple handle map, suitable for many applications of the event
 * dispatcher mechnism. It can be used as mapping from some OS event handles (e.g. Rx CAN
 * frame handles) to the zero based index space of a dispatcher object.\n
 *   The implementation supports the interfaces defined by the event sender and dispatcher
 * engine and the map is therefore most easy to use in this context. Just create a map
 * object and pass it to the constructor of sender or dispatcher object.\n
 *   The implementation of this map uses a direct lookup table, i.e. the map is highly
 * execution time efficient, O(1), and can be applied for arbitrary mappings as long as the
 * convered OS handle and index spaces suffice. These spaces are kept little, they spawn an
 * 8 Bit range only, in order to not waste much expensive RAM.\n
 *   Most use cases will have a few kinds of events, which know an event handle for further
 * distinction of events of the kind. (CAN: Message Rx and Tx events.) Many other events
 * won't use a handle but stand for themselves. (CAN: Bus-off, bus on) To support these
 * without wasting useless lookup RAM, the implementation offers an alternative, "simple"
 * mapping: A single map value is stored for each of these kinds of events.

/**
 * This function helps to prepare the map.\n
 *   1. Use case mapping external events to registered event sources:\n
 *   A single association as appears in each event registration is added to the map.
 * This function is called once per registered event source as sub-routine of
 * ede_registerEventSource().\n
 *   May be NULL. In many environments, the required map is trivial (e.g. the
 * identity) or known (and generated as ROM table) and no code is required to built-up
 * the map.\n
 *   2. Use case mapping external evemts to a sender's port:\n
 *   The function is currently not called by the dispatcher engine or sender
 * implementation. The integration code is in charge of providing the map contents and
 * it may or may not make use of this function to buildup the map.\n
 *   May be NULL to indicate that operation is not required.\n
 *   @return
 * The function will return \a true, if the new key, value pair could be considered.
 * The implementation of the map may be limited by size or otherwise. If the map entry
 * could not be made the external function may return \a false and, later at run-time,
 * the sender or dispatcher engine will ignore all events, which origin from the
 * related event source.
 *   @param hMap
 * This is the identification of the map object to use.
 *   @param kindOfEvent
 * An event is characterized by its kind and by the sender's handle. The meaning of
 * both values is transparent to sender and dispatcher engine. They will be defined by
 * the integrating environment. A common use case would for example be: Kind is "CAN Rx
 * event" and sender handle is CAN message ID.
 *   @param senderHandleEvent
 * See \a kindOfEvent.
 *   @param mapValue
 * The value of the pair to add to the map. This value needs to be returned by 
 * getValue() if the same event characterization is provided.\n
 *   Use cases: It's either the zero based index of a registered event source or the
 * zero based index of a sender's port.
 *   @remark
 * This function is called in the system initialization phase, i.e. in a single
 * threaded, still race condition free context.
