 * given.\n
 *   In the Arduino integration operating system handle and dispatcher engine handle are
 * except for a known offset identical as zero based indexes are used for both. We don't
 * build a mapping table and don't really need this function but we apply it yet for
 * checking the expected relation between the handles. An assertion fires if they would
 * not.
 *   @return
 * This map implementation will never fail to add a new entry and it always returns \a
 * true.
 *   @param hInstance
 * The map instance. We make the distinction between CAN Rx events and bus events. Pass
 * #APT_IDX_DISPATCHER_FRAME_EVENTS or #APT_IDX_DISPATCHER_BUS_EVENTS, respectively.
 *   @param kindOfEvent
 * A bus event or #APT_EV_RX_CAN_MSG.
 *   @param osHandleFrame
 * The identification of the frame as operating system handle. Ignored for bus events.
 *   @param edeIdxFrame
 * The handle of the registered event source as used in the dispatcher engine.\n
 *   This handle kind has some simple characteristics, which can help to find the easiest
 * possible implementation of the needed mapping table:\n
 *   - The handle is a linear zero based index
 *   - The handles are assigned in the order of registration calls, i.e. this function will
 * always see the handle values starting with zero in its first invokation, followed by
 * one, two and so forth
 *   @remark
 * This function is called during initialization of the CAN interface, which is done in a
 * race condition free, single threaded context. This function is called repeatedly for
 * each known frame and bus event but the calls will be strictly sequential.

         This sample application purposely makes no use of the map sample implementations,
       which come along with the CAN interface. The application demonstrates that it is
       possible to implement a specific map on-the-fly, which fits optimally to the given
       integration scenario. There's a good chance that this specific implementation is
       more efficient in terms of RAM and CPU consumption. */

       implementation of the callbacks, which handle the notifications are purposely not
       auto-coded by the code generator. It could easily do as the network databases list
       the buses, too, but the added value would be quite low; the set of buses is very
       small and predetermined and fixed. Providing the code in templates is inefficient
       under these circumstances.

       requires that we register the bus-off events prior to the (variable number of) CAN
       message events. This leads to the assumed identity mapping for bus events. */
