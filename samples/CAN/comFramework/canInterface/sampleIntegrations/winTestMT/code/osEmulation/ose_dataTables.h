 * This module contains the data tables, which are required by the CAN transmission
 * simulation in the emulated operating system. The hand-coded module \a
 * ose_operatingSystemEmulation declares the data tables as extern and the code generator
 * generates then from the CAN databases. This way the simulation knowns, which CAN frames
 * to simulate and how to.
