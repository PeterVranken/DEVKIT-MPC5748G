/** The size of the heap memory, which is statically allocated for the CAN interface. The
    value should be set as little as possible; if set too little then the application will
    abort with an assertion. This is safe due to the static, deterministic memory
    allocation concept: If no assertion fires in DEBUG compilation during development then
    it is for sure that the production code compilation won't see a lack of memory
    neither.
      @remark Consider to begin with a large value and then use the function \a
    mem_getNbrOfAllocatedChunks in DEBUG compilation in order to get the optimal setting
    for this define.
      @remark Compilation for win64 requires significantly more memory than for win32: All
    the pointers and int variables in the data structures have double the size. */
