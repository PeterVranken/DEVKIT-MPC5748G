/**

 * This is the main entry point into the sample integration and application of the
 * comFramework CAN interface on an Arduino Atmega2560 RTuinOS platform. Initialization,
 * root task functions and the idle loop of the RTOS are implemented here.
 *
 * @remark TBC
 *   The compilation of this sample requires linkage against the stdio library with
 * floating point support for printf & co. The selection of this library is done in the
 * makefile "callback" into tc14.mk (see above).
