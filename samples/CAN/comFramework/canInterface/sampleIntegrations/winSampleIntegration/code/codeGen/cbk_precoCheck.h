/**
 * @file cbk_precoCheck.h
 * 
 * This header file contains a number of compile time checks of static elements of the
 * network database, which need to be fulfilled for successful compilation and execution of
 * the generated code.\n
 *   The file is included by the generated file cbk_callbacks.c after setting a number of
 * #define's that are related to frames and signals. These defines are checked for valid
 * values. The checks are completed by some tests of the attributes, which the code
 * generation depends on. It's highly probable that these tests will emit a compile time
 * error if the code generation is done with an arbitrary other network file.
 *   @remark
 * All checks relate to static properties of the network database. If these tests can be
 * done by code generation template expressions (mainly the test of Boolean object
 * properties and test of existence of objects) then this way is preferred. Code generation
 * templates can't do numeric comparisons. If those are required than the code generation
 * process generates according C preprocessor conditions with #error directives. Since the
 * former kind of tests is frequently used you will not see anything in this file about
 * most of the tests! Error code will show up only if the error has been detected in the
 * network file.
 *
