/**
 * @file dpy_display.cpp
 *   A class around the LCD display object grants properly synchronized access to the LCD
 * from different RTuinOS tasks. The display becomes a shared resource.\n
 *   The class only offers some application specific, formatted print functions. No other
 * information than anticpated by these functions can be written to the display. With other
 * words, the entire layout design of the application output is controlled by this module.
