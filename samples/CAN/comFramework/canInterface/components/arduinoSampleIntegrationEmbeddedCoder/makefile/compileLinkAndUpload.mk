#
# Preconditions
# =============
#
# The makefile is intended to be executed by the GNU make utility coming along with the
# Arduino package.
#   The name of the project can be assigned to the makefile macro project, see heading part
# of the code section of this makefile. If you don't do, your compilation products will use
# a standard name.
#   The makefile hard codes the hardware target. Among more, see makefile macros
# targetMicroController, cFlags and lFlags. Here, you will have to make some changes
# according to your selection of an ATmega micro controller. More changes will be required
# to the command lines of the object file tool avr-objcopy and the flash tool avrdude.
#   Hint: To find out how to run these tools, you can enable verbose mode in the Arduino
# IDE and compile one of the code examples. Build and upload the sketch in the IDE, then
# copy the contents of the IDE's output window and paste them into a text editor. You will
# find appropriate command lines for all the tools.
#   The Arduino installation directory needs to be referenced. The location is determined
# by environment variable ARDUINO_HOME. The variable holds the name of the folder in which
# the arduino executable is present. Caution: This variable is not created by the original
# Arduino installation process but needs to be created manually.
#   For your convenience, the Windows path should contain the location of the GNU make
# processor. If you name this file either makefile or GNUmakefile you will just have to
# type "make" in order to get your make process running. Typically, the path to the
# executable is $(ARDUINO_HOME)hardware/tools/avr/utils/bin. Consider to extend the
# Windows environment variable PATH accordingly.
#   This makefile does not handle blanks in any paths or file names. Please rename your
# paths and files accordingly prior to using this makefile.
#
# Targets
# =======
#
# The makefile provides several targets, which can be combined on the command line. Get
# some help on the available targets by invoking the makefile using
#   make help
#
# Options
# =======
#
# Options may be passed on the command line.
#   The follow options may be used:
#   CONFIG: The compile configuration is one out of DEBUG (default) or PRODUCTION. By
# means of defining or undefining macros for the C compiler, different code configurations
# can be produced. Please refer to the comments below to get an explanation of the meaning
# of the supported configurations and which according #defines have to be used in the C
# source code files.
#   COM_PORT: The communication port to be used by the flash tool needs to be known. The
# default may be adjusted to your environment in the heading part of the code section of
# this makefile or you may override the variable setting on the make processor's command
# line by writing e.g. make COM_PORT=\\.\COM3.
#   IO_FLOAT_LIB: If this flag is 0 the stdio library with reduced floating point support
# is linked with the RTuinOS application. printf & co do nor recognize floating point
# format characters like %f. This reduces the size of the code by about 1.5kByte, the RAM
# size is not affected. By default this falg is set to 1 and full support of printf & co is
# ensured.
#
# Input Files
# ===========
#
# The makefile compiles and links all source files which are located in a given list of
# source directories. The basic list of directories is hard coded in the makefile, please look
# for the setting of srcDirList below. Additional directories can be specified in the
# application "callback makefile" code/arduinoSampleIntegration.mk.
#   A second list of files is found as cFileListExcl. These C/C++ files are excluded from
# build. The list can be extended in the application "callback makefile", too.
#   Additionally required Arduino library files are hard coded in this makefile. They are
# referenced by absolute paths into the Arduino installation directory. Therefore, the
# installation directory needs to be known by means of an environment variable called
# ARDUINO_HOME.
#   These settings are invariant throughout the project life time and don't need
# maintenance.


#   Specify a blank separated list of directories holding source files.
srcDirList := code/RTOS/

# Exclusion list: Basically all C/C++ source files found in the source directories are
# compiled and linked. Here, you can specify some particular files, which must not be
# included in the build.
cFileListExcl :=

# Double-check environment.
#   The original Arduino code is referenced in the Arduino installation directory. By
# default the location of this is not known. To run this makefile an environment variable
# needs to point to the right location. This is checked now.
ifdef ARDUINO_HOME
    # Ensure a trailing slash at the end of this externally set variable.
	ARDUINO_HOME := $(patsubst %/,%,$(subst \,/,$(ARDUINO_HOME)))/
else
    $(error Variable ARDUINO_HOME needs to be set prior to running this makefile. It points \
to the installation directory of the Arduino environment, where arduino.exe is located)
endif

# Read support code for different operating systems, Windows and Linux in the first place.

# Find out, where all external tools are located.

# A "callback" into the application permits to do some application dependent settings. Use
# cases: Modify srcDirList and/or cFileListExcl to redefine the set of source files that
# make up the application or state if an application requires the stdio floating point
# library. Hyphen: The include is optional.
