This folder contains a makefile, which implements a customizable and
widely reusable build process for a typical C toolchain. It can be used
with Windows compilers for Windows and for cross compilers for embedded
systems.

The makefile is compatible with GNU make, revision 3.82 or newer, in the
MinGW port. (The Cygwin/msys port has another interface with the
underlying shell and fails to interpret this makefile.)

The makefile is composed from a user visible main makefile, GNUmakefile in
the root of the compilation project, and several sub-makefiles, which are
collected in this folder.

The main makefile contains most of the configuration, which needs to be
done for the compilation of a specific product in a given environment. The
configuration of the makefile for a given environment is rather done in
the sub-makefiles found here. This is the idea behind this distinction:

Configuration for a given environment means the setup of tools and their
command lines for a specific combination of target platform and chosen
toolchain. Different toolchain vendors require different command line
settings for their compilers. Another aspect could be the host machine with its
specific installation paths. These kind of things have to be configured
once in the sub-makefiles.

Once the platform and environment related configuration has been done, any
new compilation project can be setup for the same system by only
adjusting the rather simple and straightforward settings in the main
makefile. These settings are application related, it is about source file
location, include directories or defines to be set.

== Platform configuration

The platform configuration is reasonably done step by step. The steps to
take are outlined in this section.

TIP: You will find commented expressions beginning with: _#$(info ..._ at
many locations. These lines provide feedback about intermediate processing
results. During configuration it'll often be beneficial to selectively and
temporarily uncomment these lines.

=== Location of tools

The makefile requires the call of externals tools. This is not only
compiler and linker but commonly used things like "rm", "echo" or "mkdir",
too. They need to be found by the shell, which is invoked by make.

Take a look into sub-makefile _locateTools.mk_. It offers different
combined ways to find the needed tools. Specific environment variables can
be checked, the system search path can be used or fixed paths to the
executables can be hard-coded.

The sub-makefile does some sample spot-checks, whether the needed tools
are found. As long as your configuration of tool locations is obviously
not properly done the makefile will immediately abort with some supporting
error information.

Insofar is the best way to prove successful completion of this step running
the makefile with target "help". If:

    make help

lists the options of the makefile and doesn't print an error message, then
you probably completed this step successfully.

=== Global settings of build process

The makefile makes use of a few global variables to configure some offered
features. A most important example is the root path for compiled binaries.
Most typical is putting them into a folder like _bin/obj_, however, this
is not mandatory but a matter of setting an according variable.

Please take a look at sub-makefile _globalVariables.mk_. The
customization variables are listed and documented in this file.

=== The compiler and linker settings

Each compiler toolchain requires its specific command line options for
compilation and linkage. Their configuration is handled in sub-makefile
_compileAndLink.mk_. The file uses variables "cFlags", "asmFlags" and
"lFlags" for the call of C compiler, assembler and linker and in some
cases it may be sufficient to just edit the values assigned to these
variables.

In general, this won't be enough. The file has a lot of makefile code,
which implements platform specific aspects.

As an example, in this project
we have a target with an inhomogeneous multi-core processor. It has
differing computation cores, which require different compiler command
lines. Accordingly, the makefile has some very platform specific conditional
code to handle this.

Also typical would be collecting sub-sets of the object files in a library
prior to linkage. Or even not linking at all if the build product is a
library.

In general, customizing the calls of compiler, assembler, linker, archiver
(and maybe post-processing tools) will require completely revising and
maybe extending file _compileAndLink.mk_. There will be much re-usable
stuff, stuff to modify and missing stuff.

== Application level customization

At this point, take a look at GNUmakefile in the root folder of the
compilation project. Here, you will specify, which source files to build
and what the name of the build product is. The customization is done with
some top-level global variables, which are documented in the file.

The basic behavior of the makefile is to search a list of folders for
source files. Due to the recursive folder search it often suffices to
specify a single source code folder. The source files are identified by
file name extension. We support _*.cpp_, _*.c_ and _*.S_ for C++, C and
assembly files.

Folders, which at least one source file was found in, are considered
include directories for the compiler, too. If you have separate folder,
containing only header files, then you would need to specify these folders
in another variable, too.

An additional list allows to set #defines, which are propagated to
compiler and assembler and which allow to control the compilation of
conditional source code constructs.

== Running the makefile

After customization, you can try running the makefile. The most basic calls
would be:footnote:[Note, the useful but not essential command line option
-O is not available in make 3.82. It requires revision 4.]


      make help
      make -s -O build
      make clean
      
Note, "make help" will print some additional useful command line options.

=== Working directory

The makefile makes use of relative paths to keep implementation and
customization independent from particular folder structures on the
machine. This requires a well-defined working directory: It generally
holds, that the working directory for make needs to be the very folder,
where _GNUmakefile_ resides in.
