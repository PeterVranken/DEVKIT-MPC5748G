/* This file defines the memory map of physical memory for the linker. We have a single

   contiguous RAM area, where all data sections go.

   allows code execution from RAM (for ease of development and debugging). Some makefile
   conditional code decides whether this file or the other memory map definition is read by
   the linker. */
