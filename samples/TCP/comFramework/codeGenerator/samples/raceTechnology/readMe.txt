The files in folder output (C code and an overview on the frames and
signals) were generated by the Java application codeGenerator. As an
exception, the file overview.html has been generated with Emacs from
overview.org by M-x org-export-as-html.

The code generation can be repeated by running the Windows script
generateCode.cmd from this working directory. Repeating the code
generation should be tried as kind of installation test of the
application.

If you want to run the application from another working folder then you
will have to modify the script: The Windows script references the required
resources by relative paths from here. Please, refer to
codeGenerator\doc\installation.txt, too.

All Windows scripts are trivial; porting them to Linux or Mac OS is
straightforward.
