    @defgroup enet Ethernet MAC (ENET) / Fast Ethernet Controller (FEC)
    The S32 SDK provides a peripheral driver for the Ethernet MAC (ENET) / Fast Ethernet Controller (FEC) module of S32 SDK devices.

    The core implements a dual-speed 10/100-Mbit/s (some platforms might also support 1000Mbit/s) Ethernet MAC
	compliant with the IEEE802.3-2002 standard.
    The MAC layer provides compatibility with half- or fullduplex 10/100-Mbit/s Ethernet LANs (and full-duplex
	gigabit for some platforms).
    
    The MAC operation is fully programmable and can be used in Network Interface Card (NIC), bridging, or
    switching applications. The core implements the remote network monitoring (RMON) counters according
    to IETF RFC 2819.
    
    The core also implements a hardware acceleration block to optimize the performance of network controllers
    providing TCP/IP, UDP, and ICMP protocol services. The acceleration block performs critical functions in
    hardware, which are typically implemented with large software overhead.

    The core implements programmable embedded FIFOs that can provide buffering on the receive path for lossless
    flow control.

    Advanced power management features are available with magic packet detection and programmable power-down modes.

    A unified DMA (uDMA), internal to the ENET/FEC module, optimizes data transfer between the MAC core and the SoC,
    and supports an enhanced buffer descriptor programming model to support IEEE 1588 functionality.

    The programmable Ethernet MAC with IEEE 1588 integrates a standard IEEE 802.3 Ethernet MAC with a time-stamping
    module. The IEEE 1588 standard provides accurate clock synchronization for distributed control nodes for industrial
    automation applications.
    
    ## Hardware background ##

    Features of the ENET/FEC module include:
        - Implements the full 802.3 specification with preamble/SFD generation, frame
        padding generation, CRC generation and checking

            providing flow control without user application intervention
            - Pause quanta used to form pause frames — dynamically programmable
            - Pause frame generation additionally controllable by user application offering
            flexible traffic flow control
            - Optional forwarding of received pause frames to the user application
            - Implements standard flow-control mechanism
        - In half-duplex mode: provides full collision support, including jamming, backoff,
        and automatic retransmission
        - Supports VLAN-tagged frames according to IEEE 802.1Q
        - Programmable MAC address: Insertion on transmit; discards frames with
        mismatching destination address on receive (except broadcast and pause frames)
        - Programmable promiscuous mode support to omit MAC destination address
        checking on receive
        - Multicast and unicast address filtering on receive based on 64-entry hash table,
        reducing higher layer processing load
        - Programmable frame maximum length providing support for any standard or
        proprietary frame length
        - Statistics indicators for frame traffic and errors (alignment, CRC, length) and pause
        frames providing for IEEE 802.3 basic and mandatory management information
        database (MIB) package and remote network monitoring (RFC 2819)
        - Simple handshake user application FIFO interface with fully programmable depth
        and threshold levels
        - Provides separate status word for each received frame on the user interface providing
        information such as frame length, frame type, VLAN tag, and error information
        - Multiple internal loopback options
        - MDIO master interface for PHY device configuration and management
        - Supports legacy FEC buffer descriptors
    
    IP protocol performance optimization features (available only for ENET):
        - Operates on TCP/IP and UDP/IP and ICMP/IP protocol data or IP header only
        - Enables wire-speed processing
        - Supports IPv4 and IPv6
        - Transparent passing of frames of other types and protocols
        - Supports VLAN tagged frames according to IEEE 802.1q with transparent
        forwarding of VLAN tag and control field
        - Automatic IP-header and payload (protocol specific) checksum calculation and
        verification on receive
        - Automatic IP-header and payload (protocol specific) checksum generation and
        automatic insertion on transmit configurable on a per-frame basis
        - Supports IP and TCP, UDP, ICMP data for checksum generation and checking
        - Supports full header options for IPv4 and TCP protocol headers
        - Provides IPv6 support to datagrams with base header only — datagrams with
        extension headers are passed transparently unmodifed/unchecked
        - Provides statistics information for received IP and protocol errors
        - Configurable automatic discard of erroneous frames
        - Configurable automatic host-to-network (RX) and network-to-host (TX) byte order
        conversion for IP and TCP/UDP/ICMP headers within the frame
        - Configurable padding remove for short IP datagrams on receive
        - Configurable Ethernet payload alignment to allow for 32-bit word-aligned header
        and payload processing
        - Programmable store-and-forward operation with clock and rate decoupling FIFOs

    Platform-dependent features (might not be available on some platforms, see chip-specific ENET information for details):
		- Gigabit full-duplex operation (actual throughput is greater than 100 Mbit/s but significantly less than 1000 Mbit/s)
        - Interrupt coalescing reduces the number of interrupts generated by the MAC, reducing CPU loading
        - Traffic-shaping bandwidth distribution supports credit-based and round-robin-based
        policies. Either policy can be combined with time-based shaping.
        - AVB (Audio Video Bridging, IEEE 802.1Qav) features:
            - Credit-based bandwidth distribution policy can be combined with time-basedshaping
            - AVB endpoint talker and listener support
            - Support for arbitration between different priority traffic (for example, AVB class A, AVB class B, and non-AVB)
        - Receive frame parser enables flexible Ethernet frame pattern matching in order to finally accept or reject a frame.

    Platform-dependent limitations:
        - MPC5743R, MPC5745R, MPC5746R, MPC5775B, MPC5775E, MPC5777C: Transmission ring size must be at least 2.

    ## How to use the ENET driver in your application ##
    
    In order to use the ENET driver in your application, the <b>ENET_DRV_Init()</b> function
    should be called prior to using the rest of the API. The parameters of this function specify:
        - the ENET instance to be initialized
        - a structure which will hold the internal state of the driver
        - a structure specifying the configuration of the ENET module
        - an array of structures specifying the configuration of the buffers (one structure for each pair of Rx and Tx rings)
        - the MAC address to be configured for the module
    
    The configuration of the module is specified through the <b>enet_config_t</b> structure and contains:
        - MII-related configurations (mode, speed, duplex)
        - acceleation options for the receive and transmit path
        - the maximum frame length
        - the MAC interrupt sources which should be enabled
        - other special configurations of the receive and transmit path
        - a callback function to be invoked on events
        - the number of Rx and Tx pairs of rings used by the driver
    
    The buffers configuration is specified through the <b>enet_buffer_config_t</b> structure and contains:
        - the size of the Rx and Tx rings
        - pointers to the beginning of the Rx and Tx buffer descriptors rings (should be 64-bit aligned)
        - pointer to the beginning of the memory area where the received data shall be saved (should be 64-bit aligned)
    
    In order to de-initialize the driver, the ENET_DRV_Deinit() function shall be used. This function will disable the ENET interrupts
    and the module, so calling other ENET driver functions after de-initializing the driver will have undefined behavior. In order to
    use the driver again, ENET_DRV_Init() should be called.
