== About this DEVKIT-MPC5748G sample

This DEVKIT-MPC5748G sample integrates the most popular Open Source
Internet Protocol stack, which is
https://savannah.nongnu.org/news/?group=lwip[lwIP^]. lwIP offers TCP and
UDP and some sub-ordinated protocols, e.g., MDNS for node name resolution. lwIP
itself doesn't contain the Ethernet device driver layer. This sample
integrates an Ethernet driver from the
https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/development-software/s32-sdk/s32-software-development-kit-for-power-architecture:S32SDK-POWER-ARCHITECTURE[NXP Software Development Kit for Power Architecture^].
Here are some features of the sample:

* Integration of lwIP release 2.2 (Sep 25, 2023).
* Integration of Ethernet driver from NXP SDK 3.0.1.
* The lwIP standard IP application ping is enabled.
* IP protocol MDNS is enabled and allows addressing to the board by name
  as well as by IP address.
* TFTP is enabled and allows data upload from the board. Only a minimal
  code extension would be required to demonstrate data download, too.
* HTTP protocol is enabled. The board provides a minimalistic Web-page.
* An own, project specific IP application demonstrates how to use TCP for
  the proprietary communication needed by your own application.
* The pin configuration has been made for board DEVKIT-MPC5748G; just
  connect your PC and the evaluation board by LAN wire and try the
  software.

lwIP is distributed as source code and it was possible to use the original
source code without any modification. This will make a later upgrade to a
new release of lwIP most easy. Just replace folder
`lwip-STABLE-2_2_0_RELEASE` with a more recent download and re-build the
sample.

The NXP Ethernet driver underwent some modifications to make it compatible
with the
https://github.com/PeterVranken/DEVKIT-MPC5748G/tree/master/samples/safe-RTOS/doc/manual#io-driver-model[I/O driver model^]
of safe-RTOS. Moreover, a minor extension of its state
model was required for safe buffer management. Please note, NXP software
is freely available and may be used on NXP MCUs without restriction but
it's not Open Source. The license terms are found as
https://github.com/PeterVranken/DEVKIT-MPC5748G/blob/master/samples/TCP/code/system/drivers/ETH/RTM/license.txt[`code/system/drivers/ETH/RTM/license.txt`^].

== Behavior of the sample application

Sample TCP builds on the elder sample CAN. The CAN stack is still
integrated and working the same way as it does in sample CAN. To
demonstrate the capabilities of TCP based communication the behavior of
the elder SW has been adopted by the new one. The elder sample offered to
add selected CAN signals to its listener and the values of these signals
become reported when the containing message is received. Reporting had
been done in the serial terminal window. Now, the same information is
distributed by TCP. A Telnet client running on the PC can make a
connection to the evaluation board and will receive all the information
about received CAN signals. Several Telnet clients can try to connect
simultaneously. (The maximum number allowed is a compile time constant.)

Besides this application specific demonstration of TCP/IP communication,
there are some lwIP standard applications, which are enabled, too. Out of
the box, the board will respond to ping requests (ICMP protocol is
enabled), it can be addressed by name ("DEVKIT-MPC5748G") as well as by IP
address (192.168.1.200) because of the MDNS service, data can be fetched
using the Trivial FTP protocol and last but not least, the board can be
addressed with an HTTP request from a normal browser window.
Unfortunately, HTTPS is not supported.

Control of the sample application and status feedback are both done via
the serial interface, see below.

All IP communication is done via the only Ethernet plug of the evaluation
board. The IP address is 192.168.1.200 and the port number depends on the
IP application, see below.

All CAN communication is done via the only CAN transceiver of the
evaluation board. The CAN bus is configured to run at 500 kBd.

The messages from the
https://github.com/PeterVranken/DEVKIT-MPC5748G/blob/master/samples/TCP/code/application/canStack/dbcFiles/sampleCanBus.dbc[CAN database^]
(a *.dbc file) are registered at the BSW. Periodic Tx messages are
sent with the signal default values and Rx messages are received and
the signal values are internally stored.

Optionally, and by default, a second *.dbc file
https://github.com/PeterVranken/DEVKIT-MPC5748G/blob/master/samples/TCP/code/application/canStack/dbcFiles/PWM.dbc[PWM.dbc^]
is merged into the communication on the same bus. It defines two
messages, one to control some PWM output channels and one to broadcast the
measurement results from two PWM inputs.

The application has a user interface based on serial I/O. You need to open
a terminal application on your development host machine, which the
evaluation board is connected to via USB. The NXP software implements a
virtual COM device on the host machine; open this COM channel with 115200
Bd, 8 Bit, no parity bit, 1 stop bit. Type *help* to begin. A usage

message is printed with the available commands.

The principal commands are:

* *listen:* A signal from one of the Rx messages in the CAN database is
named. On every future reception of the message, which contains this
signal, the newly received signal value will be printed into your console
and potentially to the TCP/IP connections with TCP port 1234, which have
been established from the host machine using an application like Telnet.

* *set:* A signal is named together with a numeric value. The internally
held signal value is changed accordingly. For regular messages it means
that the new value will be considered at the next due time of the message.
For event messages, the command is at the same time the triggering event
and the message is sent immediately with the new value

* *show:* Enable or disable regular reporting of particular events, e.g.
the PWM measurement results

* *PWM:* Set the new frequency and duty cycle of a PWM output -- if it is
not currently under control of the CAN interface.

Some additional commands are available, too.

Controlling the PWM outputs via CAN is explained best by looking into file
https://github.com/PeterVranken/DEVKIT-MPC5748G/blob/master/samples/TCP/code/application/canStack/dbcFiles/PWM.dbc[PWM.dbc^].
The CAN message PWM_out has signals to set frequency and duty cycle of the
connected PWM channels and there is a Boolean to switch between CAN
control and control via command line otherwise.

The effect is strongest if the PWM output PA1, on extension port J3, pin 1
is connected to both PWM inputs, PA2 on J3, pin 3 and PA6 on J2, pin1. At
PA2 the frequency of the PWM is measured and at PA6 its duty, i.e., high
time. If both inputs are fed with the same input then the duty cycle in
percent can be calculated.

=== How to run the integrated IP applications

This is the configuration to run the IP applications, which are already
integrated into sample application `TCP`:

. Connect the DEVKIT-MPC5748G via USB with your PC.
. Connect the DEVKIT-MPC5748G via LAN wire with your PC. Using a switch
  in between is possible. Connecting both, PC and DEVKIT-MPC5748G, to an
  Internet router is possible, too, but then the source code will need to
  be configured for using DHCP (see below). In the following, it is
  assumed that this is not the case.
. Connect the DEVKIT-MPC5748G via a CAN adapter with your PC.
. On the PC, open a serial terminal program and connect to the
  DEVKIT-MPC5748G (see above for details).
. On the PC, open a shell window, e.g., PowerShell.
. On the PC, open a Web browser.
. On the PC, open a CAN tool, which allows displaying received CAN
  messages and sending messages.
. Most useful but not required: On the PC, open Open Source program
  Wireshark and let it log the traffic on the Ethernet plug you connected
  the DEVKIT-MPC5748G to.

==== Pinging the board or Internet protocols ICMP and ARB

In the shell window, type:

  ping 192.168.1.200

or, using the ARB protocol for name resolution:

  ping DEVKIT-MPC5748G

The console output should resemble:

  Pinging 192.168.1.200 with 32 bytes of data:
  Reply from 192.168.1.200: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
  Reply from 192.168.1.200: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=128
  Reply from 192.168.1.200: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
  Reply from 192.168.1.200: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128

==== Ping client

The DEVKIT-MPC5748G can use protocol ICMP as ping client, too. A single
IPv4 target address can be served at a time.footnote:[LwIP's ping sample
application supports IPv6, too. It's just the rudimentary serial console
user interface, which imposes the limitation for IPv4.] Regularly, a ping
request is sent to this address and the response time is displayed.
(Nothing is displayed if no response is timely received.) Turning pinging
on and off and setting the target address is under control of the serial
console. In your terminal's input window, type *help* and read the
explanation of command *ping*.

In the terminal window, type:

  help
  ping 142 250 179 206

to ping Google and, after a while:

  ping off

Note, that the example requires an Internet connection to succeed. Use the
IPv4 address of any local node if there is no Internet connection.

==== Trivial File Transfer Protocol

The sample application integrates a file transfer protocol, which allows
to download bulky data from and upload to the running application.

The application doesn't have a file system in the meaning of FAT or NTFS,
but to the applied protocol TFTP, it doesn't matter, what actually a
"file" is. It just hands the file name or path designation over to the
application and transmits the data set it gets in response. Only the
length of the file designation is limited by a compile-time configuration
item (20 characters by default). Within this limit there's virtually no
limitation in how to interpret the received file designation and what data
to return in response to it. Or, vice versa, how to make use of the
uploaded "file" contents.

In the shell window, type:

  tftp 192.168.1.200 GET /path/to/some/data someData.txt

or, using the ARB protocol for name resolution:

  tftp DEVKIT-MPC5748G GET /path/to/some/data someData.txt

The application demonstrates the use of TFTP by returning a "file", which
consists of a number of repetitions of the name (or path) of the requested
file. If the command succeeds, then a file `someData.txt` will be found in
the current working directory, which contains the character string
"/path/to/some/data" a couple of times. Looking into the sample code,
source code file `code/application/ipStack/apps/tftp_example.c`,
it'll be straight forward to replace this behavior with returning some
true data depending on the requested file name.

The application doesn't have sample code for the TFTP command PUT yet, but
the source code structures to use this command for uploading data to the
application are fully in place and can be used.

==== HTTP

The application integrates a minimalistic HTTP server, providing a small
Web-page. In the address field of the Web browser, type:

  http://192.168.1.200/get

or, using the ARB protocol for name resolution:

  http://devkit-mpc5748g/get

The Web-page should be displayed. The contents are no more than a greeting
plus a bit of dynamic content, but could be made more useful and realistic
by elaboration of the source code in file
`code/application/ipStack/apps/http_demoHttpServer.c`.

Please note, as an alternative, and maybe more suitable for testing, you
may type this in the shell window:

  curl http://192.168.1.136/get -o -

or:

  curl http://DEVKIT-MPC5748G/get -o -

Sadly, HTTPS is not supported and it won't be easy to add this protocol.

==== TCP server application

A typical TCP server application is integrated. A client can connect to
the DEVKIT-MPC5748G and receive information (or send commands or data).
Our sample application sends the information as a stream of printable,
formatted output so that the standard program telnet can be used for
demonstration. In the shell window, type:

  telnet 192.168.1.200 1234

or, using the ARB protocol for name resolution:

  telnet DEVKIT-MPC5748G 1234

The port number, 1234, is a compile-time configuration item and can be
modified in source file
`code/application/ipStack/apps/clg_canLoggerOnTCP.c`. The TCP server
exploits the code from the elder sample application
https://github.com/PeterVranken/DEVKIT-MPC5748G/tree/master/samples/CAN[`CAN`^]:
One or more CAN signals can be registered for "listening". When the CAN
message is received, which contains this signal, then a message is written
indicating the received signal value(s). In the elder sample, this message
was written to the serial terminal, now it is sent to the connected telnet
client(s), too.

Note, the set of signals, which can be selected for listening depends on
the DBC file(s), which are compiled into the application. (See other
sample application
https://github.com/PeterVranken/DEVKIT-MPC5748G/tree/master/samples/CAN[`CAN`^]
for details.) In the serial terminal program, you may type (and send),
e.g.:

  listen PA1_J3_pin1_frequency

Use your CAN tool to regularly -- not too frequently -- send message
`PWM_out`, CAN ID 1001, and vary the value of signal
`PA1_J3_pin1_frequency`. Telnet should report the received values.

More than one telnet connection can be opened at a time. The maximum
number is limited and the limit is a compile-time configuration item.

The code skeleton found in source file
`code/application/ipStack/apps/clg_canLoggerOnTCP.c` can be the starting
point for the development of your TCP server(s).footnote:[Any number of
such servers can co-exist if they only use different port numbers.] Just
replace the data writing part; most of the connection management and error
handling will be re-usable.

Data input is only hinted at. Our TCP server just evaluates the input
Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D to gracefully terminate the connection.


== Safety features

The integration of lwIP demonstrates how it is possible to run nearly the
entire IP stack inside the protected user context. Only the (quite lean)
Ethernet driver is running in the kernel context and would need to
undergo all safety validation. All of the lwIP implementation and the TCP
and UDP applications on top of lwIP are running in the QM process and can
do no harm to the operating system or the safety process.

The downside is that IP communication is not easily available to the
safety software. It is of course possible to use it with some end-to-end
protection on top, which guarantees a sufficiently high likelihood of
detecting communication failures. Regardless, if a safety relevant failure
is detected by the safety software then it must in now way try to use IP
communication to bring the system into a safe state.

== How to use lwIP for your own application

Look at the integrated and operational IP applications and use their
source code as starting point for the implementation of your IP
application:

* `code/application/ipStack/apps/http_demoHttpServer.c`: If your
  application should provide an own Web-page.
* `code/application/ipStack/apps/tftp_example.c`: If your application
  wants to use either the UDP or the TFTP protocol for data exchange in
  either direction.
* `code/application/ipStack/apps/clg_canLoggerOnTCP.c`: If your
  application wants to setup a TCP connection for bi-directional data
  exchange with another node.

== How to modify IP and MAC addresses

The MAC address is software defined at compile-time. For the IP addresses
(board and default gateway), two modes can be chosen at compile-time:
using a hard-coded IP address or enabling the lwIP implementation of a
DHCP client. The chosen values are:

[[tabIPAndMACAddress]]
.IP and MAC addresses of DEVKIT-MPC5748G
[cols="30,40", width="50%"]
|=======
|IP address  |192.168.1.200 (if DHCP is off)
|IP address gateway |192.168.1.1 (if DHCP is off)
|MAC address |12-34-56-78-9A-BC
|=======

The MAC address is set during the initialization of the Ethernet driver,
see `eth_osInitEthernetDriver()`. The address is taken from preprocessor
macro `ETH_ENET0_MAC_ADDR`, defined in file
`code/system/drivers/ETH/eth_ethernet.h`, ll.29ff:

[source,C++]
---------------------------
/** The driver enables only device ENET0, which is wired to the Ethernet plug on the
    DEVKIT-MPC5748G. The MAC address of Ethernet device ENET0 is set during driver
    initialization. The value to define is the initializer expression for an array of six
    integers. */
#define ETH_ENET0_MAC_ADDR          {0x12,0x34,0x56,0x78,0x9A,0xBC}
---------------------------

The IP address mode is defined as build parameter in the master makefile
`GNUmakefile`. See variable `defineList` for details how to enable the
DHCP client on the DEVKIT-MPC5748G. If DHCP is enabled then the IP
addresses of board and default gateway are initialized to all zeros. After
power-up, the board will wait for the DHCP server to receive the addresses
and network communication is possible only when this has succeeded.

DHCP is normally the right option, if the DEVKIT-MPC5748G is connected to
an Internet router. For a direct connection to a PC, DHCP is unlikely to
work and the IP addresses should better be hard-coded. They are defined as
preprocessor macros `NIF_NET_IF_IP_ADDR_ENET0` and
`NIF_NET_IF_IP_ADDR_GATEWAY_ENET0` in file
`code/application/ipStack/integrationLwIP/netif/nif_interfaceEthToLwIP.h`,
ll.72ff:

[source,C++]
---------------------------
/* IP addresses, etc., for Ethernet interface ENET0. */
#define NIF_NET_IF_HAS_DHCP_ENET0           false
#define NIF_NET_IF_HAS_AUTO_IP_ENET0        false
#define NIF_NET_IF_IP_ADDR_ENET0            {192,168,1,200}
#define NIF_NET_IF_ADDR_MASK_ENET0          {255,255,255,0}
#define NIF_NET_IF_IP_ADDR_GATEWAY_ENET0    {192,168,1,1}
---------------------------

CAUTION: If DHCP is enabled then the IP address of the board is unknown
before operation. In particular, the IP address 192.168.1.200, which is
mentioned throughout the documentation is not valid.

== Tools

=== Environment

==== Command line based build

The makefiles and related scripts require a few settings of the
environment in the host machine. In particular, the location of the GNU
compiler installation needs to be known and the PATH variable needs to
contain the paths to the required tools.

For Windows users there is a shortcut to PowerShell in the root of this
GitHub project, which opens the shell with the prepared environment.
Furthermore, it creates an alias to the appropriate GNU make executable.
You can simply type `make` from any location to run MinGW32 GNU make.

The PowerShell process reads the script `setEnv.ps1`, located in the
project root, too, to configure the environment. This script requires
customization prior to its first use. Windows users open it in a text
editor and follow the given instructions that are marked by TODO tags.
Mainly, it's about specifying the installation directory of GCC.

Non-Windows users will read this script to see, which (few) environmental
settings are needed to successfully run the build and prepare an according
script for their native shell.

[[secOpenEclipse]]
==== Eclipse for building, flashing and debugging

Flashing and debugging is always done using the NXP S32 Design Studio for
Power Architecture, an Eclipse IDE, which is available for free download
and nearly unrestricted use in commercial and non commercial projects.

If you are going to run the application build from the Eclipse IDE then
the same environmental settings as described above for a shell based build
need to be done for Eclipse, too. The easiest way to do so is starting
Eclipse from a shell, that has executed the script `setEnv.ps1` prior to
opening Eclipse.

For Windows users the script `S32DS-IDE.ps1` has been prepared. This script
requires customization prior to its first use. Windows users open it in a
text editor and follow the given instructions that are marked by TODO
tags. Mainly, it's about specifying the installation directory of
the S32 Design Studio.

Non-Windows users will read this script to see, which (few) environmental
and path settings are needed to successfully run the build under control
of Eclipse and prepare an according script for their native shell.

Once everything is prepared, the S32 Design Studio will never be started
other than by clicking the script `S32DS-IDE.ps1` or its equivalent on
non-Windows hosts.

TODOC: Where to get the tools, how to install them
//See https://github.com/PeterVranken/TRK-USB-MPC5643L[project overview^] and
//https://github.com/PeterVranken/TRK-USB-MPC5643L/wiki/Tools-and-Installation[GitHub
//Wiki^] for more details about downloading and installing the required
//tools.

=== Compiler and makefile

Compilation and linkage are makefile controlled. The compiler is GCC
(MinGW-powerpc-eabivle-4.9.4). It is part of the S32 Design Studio
installation and can be used independently from the Studio. The makefile
is made generic and can be reused for production projects that want to
make use of safe-RTOS. It supports a number of options (targets); get an
overview by typing:

    cd <projectRoot>/samples/CAN
    mingw32-make help

The main makefile `GNUmakefile` has been configured for the build of
sample "CAN". Type:

    mingw32-make -sO build
    mingw32-make -sO build CONFIG=PRODUCTION

to produce the flashable files
`bin\ppc\default\DEBUG\DEVKIT-MPC5748G-CAN.elf`, and
`bin\ppc\default\PRODUCTION\DEVKIT-MPC5748G-CAN.elf`.

File `GNUmakefile` has a variable `defineList`, which is a list of options
for the build. A major option is `LINK_IN_RAM`. If you place this option
into the list then the same build commands link the software for execution
in RAM. (See next section for details). With option `LINK_IN_RAM`, the same
commands:

    mingw32-make -sO build
    mingw32-make -sO build CONFIG=PRODUCTION

produce the flashable files
`bin\ppc\default\DEBUG-RAM\DEVKIT-MPC5748G-CAN.elf`, and
`bin\ppc\default\PRODUCTION-RAM\DEVKIT-MPC5748G-CAN.elf`.

To get more information, type:

    mingw32-make --help
    mingw32-make help

WARNING: The makefile requires the MinGW port of the make processor. The
Cygwin port will fail with obscure, misleading error messages. For your
convenience, we have uploaded an appropriate recent version of the MinGW
make processor into this GitHub project. The PowerShell startup script
aliases this (Windows) executable to the command `make`. Moreover,
explicitly typing `mingw32-make` will generally avoid any problem.

The makefile is designed to run on different host systems but has been
tested with Windows 7 and Windows 10 only.

[[secRunInRAM]]
=== Running your application in RAM

The makefile and the linker scripts support the location of the code
entirely in RAM. The MPC5748G has plenty of RAM so that even large pieces
of code can be loaded and executed in RAM. This is extremely helpful for
code development. Loading the code into the device's RAM is significantly
faster than into ROM and many flash erase and program cycles can be saved.
Even if your complete project may not fit into RAM then you may still
consider it useful to build some sub-modules together with their testing
code in this way.

Nothing particular has to be done to load a compiled software into RAM.
The GNU debugger in the Design Studio just looks at the addresses of code
and data objects in the binary file (`*.elf`). It'll erase and flash the
ROM if the objects have ROM addresses and it'll load them into RAM if the
objects are located in RAM. So all we have to do is defining the memory
addresses in the linker scripts accordingly in the one or the other way.

Under control of a macro in the main makefile, `GNUmakefile`, the linker
chooses different address ranges. If the macro `LINK_IN_RAM` is element of
the list of macros then the linker will divide the physically available
RAM into 67% for code or text and constant data sections (512k) and 33%
for data sections (256k). If the macro is not defined in the list then all
768k of RAM are available to the data sections.

The macro is seen by the C source code at compile-time, too. However,
there are barely dependencies. The MPU configuration is the principal
exception and some execution timing operations are dependent on the macro,
too.

To switch between linkage in ROM or RAM, open file `GNUmakefile` in a text
editor and look for the definition of variable `defineList`. The left hand
side expression is a blank-separated list of symbols, which are passed to
the compiler and linker as preprocessor #define. Add `LINK_IN_RAM` if
you want to run your code in RAM.

WARNING: Running the software in RAM is useful but, by principle, a
preliminary, temporary way of working only. Running the software can be done
only under control of the debugger, which is needed to load the binary
data into the MCU's RAM. A start of the software out of reset or after a
power-up or without connected Design Studio is impossible.

=== Flashing and debugging

The code of this DEVKIT-MPC5748G sample can be flashed and debugged with
the S32 Design Studio IDE. Effectively, flashing means to start the GNU
debugger (GDB) and to let it "load" the *.elf file. If the code is linked
in flash ROM address space then this loading means writing to the flash.
Consequently, a flash configuration in the Eclipse IDE is nearly identical
to any ordinary debug configuration, just the option "Load executable" to
load a file is checked. Ordinary debug configurations, i.e., for
debugging, don't have this check mark set:

[[figDebugConfigFlash]]
.Eclipse debug configuration, which is used for flashing
image::readMe_resources/debugConfigForFlashing.jpg[Eclipse debug configuration, which is used for flashing, width="70%", pdfwidth="70%", align="center"]

Connect your evaluation board DEVKIT-MPC5748G with the USB wire and start
the S32 Design Studio as outlined above (<<secOpenEclipse>>). Now you can
find the debug configuration shown in <<figDebugConfigFlash>> in menu
"Run/Debug Configurations..." A dialog listing all available debug
configurations opens. Type "flash" in the text box, which initially has
the focus, to filter all of them, which are intended for flashing and
select the one you need. Press the Enter key or click on button "Debug"
and the flash process begins. Progress and status messages are printed in
one of the console windows in the lower right corner.

It's a bit counter-intuitive that flashing with GDB is just a kind of side
effect of starting the debugger. Rather than with a "Congratulations,
flashing successfully completed"-message, flashing ends with a ready to
use interactive debug session: The source code window shows the startup
code for the boot core Z4A and you could go ahead and step through the
just flashed code. However, you won't typically do so and rather stop this
debug session again. This is why:

In the S32 Design Studio, a debug session for projects running _n_ cores
requires opening a combination of _n_ Eclipse debug configurations, one
for each core. Such a combination is called a "Launch Group". Our flash
configurations generally use only a single debug configuration, because
our project links all the code in one *.elf file, regardless of the number
of cores, which are in use. Therefore, if you'd really go ahead with the
flash debug session then you could only control and observe boot core Z4A.
Better to close it again and start a more appropriate Launch Group.

[[figLaunchGroup]]
.Debug configuration to chose when debugging a multi-core software
image::readMe_resources/debugLaunchGroup.jpg[Debug configuration to chose when debugging a multi-core software, width="70%", pdfwidth="70%", align="center"]

If you built your software for execution in RAM (see <<secRunInRAM>>) then
you don't need to flash. No matter what is currently flashed, just start
the according debug configuration. The RAM is loaded with your software
and you can start it with the usual debugger commands to step and run,
etc. If you end the debug session while the cores are all running (i.e.
none of the cores is halted in a breakpoint) then the software in RAM even
stays alive and can be observed without debugger connection. Only after
next reset the ROM software will take effect again.

By the way, the debug sessions can be found also by a click on the black
triangle next to the blue icon "bug". The last recently used
configurations are listed in the menu. To see all of them or to
double-check their properties you'd click "Debug Configurations...",
somewhere down below the list. In the new dialog, select the wanted one
and start the debugger with a last click on button "Debug".

=== Book E versus VLE

Only VLE code is supported.

== Known issues

. The default settings have been used for the lwIP memory management
settings. No effort has been invested in optimizing the heap and/or
pools. This will likely limit the stability of IP connections transmitting
large amounts of data.

. Debugger: If the view shows the INTC0 register set then the debugger
harmfully affects program execution and the RTOS fails: The write to
INTC_EOIR_PRC0, which normally restores the current priority level
INTC_CPR_PRC0, now fails to do so. The complete interrupt handling fails
from now on. Mostly the effect is that the OS tick interrupt, which has a
high priority, leaves this high priority level set in the INTC_CPR_PRC0,
so that effectively no interrupts (including itself) are handled any more.
Only the code of the idle task is executed any longer.

Workaround: Don't open the view of the INTC0 in the debugger when
debugging a safe-RTOS application. Then the INTC and the code work fine.

. Debugger: A similar effect has been observed with the instructions to
alter the External Interrupt enable bit, MSR[EE]. Do not single-step in
the debugger over wrtee(i) instructions. The instruction may fail to
change the bit. If the code approaches such an instruction you should use
the right-click operation "Run to line", targeting the instruction behind
the wrtee(i). This works fine.

. Debugger: A similar effect has been observed when putting a breakpoint
on the first instruction of an exception handler. (Which is indeed a
natural desire to be informed about exceptions.) The correct exception
handling is confused. The CPU state is not correctly stored in the xSRRi
registers and the MSR bits are not properly updated, at least not the
External Interrupt enable bit, MSR[EE]. Further software execution has
barely a chance. Workaround is to set the breakpoint a few instructions
further on in the exception handler.

. Debugger: It is not possible to hinder the P&E debugger from halting at
an se_illegal instruction. (See https://community.nxp.com/thread/497533)
This makes it impossible to debug the fault catching capabilities of the
RTOS. All severe code errors, which lead to the execution of an arbitrary
address, will sooner or later encounter a zero word in the instruction
stream and the debugger will break -- before the RTOS can catch the error.
It is possible to continue the code execution from the debugger and to
see, what the RTOS will do but this is an interactive process and
systematic testing of error catching code is not possible this way. We can
only do it without connected debugger.
