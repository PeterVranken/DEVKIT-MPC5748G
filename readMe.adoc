== Introduction

Software support for low cost PowerPC evaluation board DEVKIT-MPC5748G by NXP.

An initial code sample offers:

* Clean, well-documented assembly startup code for all cores (together
  with related linker script)
* Clock settings for cores and peripherals
* Generally usable crossbar configuration
* Interrupt handling
* SMPU settings suitable for all cores and to support communication between them
* Generally usable low level synchronization primitives for communication
  between cores (using the Protected Storage Controller)
* C lib support with printf via serial interface and USB connection
* Trivial application code:
 ** LEDs individually controlled from all three cores
 ** Shared counters to demonstrate cross-core communication
 ** Progress and status messages on serial interface - just open a
    terminal on your development host machine and select 115200 Bd, 8 Bit,
    1 stop bit, no parity bit
* Makefile based compilation
 ** Build from shell window for automation purpose
 ** Integration into S32 Design Studio for interactive use
* A single image (load file) for all cores
* Debugger support to flash the code from S32 Design Studio
* Debugger support to debug all cores - either from S32 Design Studio or
  from shell windows
